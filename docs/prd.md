# Lean IT Consulting Ticketing System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Eliminate revenue leakage from forgotten billable hours by enabling real-time ticket logging
- Reduce ticket creation time from minutes to under 10 seconds (target: 5 seconds)
- Decrease monthly administrative overhead from ~4 hours to under 1 hour
- Enable same-day invoice generation at month-end through seamless Xero integration
- Provide transparent, dispute-proof billing documentation for all client work
- Support 100% billable time capture with minimal friction during active work

### Background Context

Solo IT consultants and small IT consulting firms billing hourly face a critical challenge: existing ticketing systems designed for team collaboration impose unnecessary complexity that directly causes revenue loss. Current systems require slow-loading dropdowns, multiple forced fields, and multi-step workflows that transform simple billing documentation into a multi-minute interruption. This friction leads consultants to defer ticket creation, resulting in forgotten billable hoursâ€”potentially $5,000-10,000 in annual revenue loss for a typical consultant billing 85-100 hours monthly.

This PRD defines an MVP ticketing system purpose-built for billing documentation rather than task management. By reducing required fields at creation to just three essentials (client, contact, time) and enabling rich context capture at closure, the system meets consultants where they work and eliminates the barrier causing revenue leakage. The solution focuses exclusively on the billing workflow: capture time during work, review and adjust before month-end, and generate detailed Xero invoices with per-ticket line items.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** System shall support creating tickets with only three required fields at creation time: Client, Contact, and Time Entry.

**FR2:** System shall allow tickets to have optional Description and Notes fields that can be populated at creation or added/edited later before ticket closure.

**FR3:** System shall require a Description field to be populated before a ticket can be included in invoice generation, prompting the user to add descriptions to any tickets lacking them during the pre-invoice review process.

**FR4:** System shall support ticket states of Open and Closed, with ability to re-open closed tickets within 7 days of closure.

**FR5:** System shall maintain a Client database with fields for company name, one or more email domains (for auto-detection), Xero customer ID, and maintenance contract type.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The system prioritizes **speed and simplicity** over feature richness. The interface should feel lightweight and responsive, with minimal cognitive load at every interaction. The primary UX goal is to make ticket creation so fast and frictionless that users log time in real-time during work rather than deferring to memory. Secondary UX goals include confidence during month-end review (clear visibility of all billable work) and zero-confusion invoice generation (obvious what will be sent to Xero before pushing).

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Fast-form philosophy:** Ticket creation uses minimal form fields with smart defaults, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and instant submission without confirmation dialogs
- **Deferred detail capture:** System embraces the workflow of "quick capture now, rich context later" - users can return to tickets to add descriptions/notes when context is fresh
- **Dashboard-centric navigation:** Single dashboard view as home base showing open tickets, recently closed, and quick-access to month-end review
- **Inline editing:** Edit ticket details, time entries, and descriptions directly in list views without modal popups or page transitions where possible
- **Progressive disclosure:** Advanced features (search, historical tickets, client/contact management) hidden behind secondary navigation to keep primary workflow clean

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Dashboard (Home)** - Primary landing page showing open tickets, recently closed tickets, and quick stats (current month hours)
2. **Create Ticket Form** - Minimal form with Client dropdown, Contact dropdown, Time input, and optional Description/Notes
3. **Ticket Detail/Edit View** - Display and edit all ticket details including multiple time entries, with ability to add/edit description and notes
4. **Pre-Invoice Review Screen** - Month-end review showing all tickets to be invoiced, grouped by client, with totals and highlighting of missing descriptions
5. **Client Management** - CRUD interface for clients (company name, domains, Xero ID, contract type)
6. **Contact Management** - CRUD interface for contacts (name, email, associated client)
7. **Historical Ticket Search** - Simple search interface for finding closed tickets by client, date range, or keyword

### Accessibility: None

No formal accessibility compliance requirements for MVP. Standard browser accessibility features should work (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility for form fields), but WCAG conformance is not a formal requirement.

### Branding

Clean, professional, minimal aesthetic. Favor function over form. No specific brand guidelines or color palette defined for MVP. Suggested approach: Simple neutral color scheme (blues/grays for professionalism), clear typography optimized for readability, and generous whitespace to reduce visual clutter. Avoid unnecessary animations or decorative elements that could slow perceived performance.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary target is desktop browsers (where most work happens), with responsive design ensuring usability on tablets and mobile phones. Mobile experience should support common on-the-go tasks like quick ticket creation and viewing recent tickets, but month-end invoice review and client/contact management can be desktop-optimized.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing both frontend and backend code. This simplifies development, deployment, and dependency management for the MVP. The structure can be separated into polyrepo later if the project scales beyond single-user scope.

**Rationale:** Solo development with tight timeline (4-6 weeks) benefits from unified codebase. No team coordination overhead, simpler CI/CD pipeline, and easier context switching during rapid iteration.

### Service Architecture

**Monolithic web application** with clear separation between frontend (SPA), backend API layer, and data layer.

- **Frontend:** Single-page application (SPA) served as static assets
- **Backend:** RESTful API server handling business logic, Xero integration, and database operations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data (clients, contacts, tickets, time entries)

**Not using microservices or serverless** - unnecessary complexity for single-user system with straightforward workflows. All functionality deployed as single application unit.

**Rationale:** Brief emphasizes speed of development and minimal hosting costs. Monolith is fastest to build, easiest to deploy, and most cost-effective for expected load (one active user). Future Phase 2 features (Outlook extension, daily emails) can integrate with monolith via API endpoints.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit tests for critical business logic** - Focus testing effort on:
- Time entry parsing and validation (flexible format handling)
- Invoice calculation and line item formatting
- Xero API integration layer (with mocked API responses)
- Date-based filtering and time entry locking logic

**Manual testing for UI workflows** - Given tight MVP timeline and single user:
- Manual QA of ticket creation, editing, and invoice generation workflows
- Browser compatibility spot-checking on Chrome, Edge, Safari
- Responsive design manual testing on common mobile viewports

**No automated E2E or integration tests for MVP** - Trade-off accepting some risk to meet 4-6 week timeline. User will effectively perform UAT during real-world usage.

**Convenience methods for manual testing:**
- Seed script to populate test data (sample clients, contacts, tickets)
- Admin endpoint to reset Xero invoice locks for testing month-end workflow
- Database snapshot/restore utilities for safe testing

**Rationale:** YAGNI applied to testing pyramid. Critical financial calculations (time totals, invoice amounts) warrant unit tests. Complex E2E test infrastructure would consume significant timeline with marginal benefit for single-user MVP.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** Modern JavaScript framework recommended - **React** or **Vue.js** preferred for:
- Large ecosystem and component libraries (faster development)
- Strong TypeScript support (type safety for time calculations)
- Lightweight build output to meet <2 second page load NFR

**Backend Language/Framework:** **Node.js with Express** or **Python with FastAPI** recommended for:
- Excellent Xero API SDK availability (both have official/community libraries)
- Rapid development capability for REST APIs
- Shared language with frontend (Node.js) or clarity/simplicity (Python)

**Database:** **PostgreSQL** for:
- Robust relational data model (clients â†’ contacts, tickets â†’ time entries)
- JSON column support for flexible metadata storage if needed
- Reliable ACID transactions for invoice locking operations
- Free tier availability on most cloud hosting platforms

**Hosting/Deployment:** Cloud hosting with minimal DevOps overhead:
- **Heroku**, **Railway**, **Render**, or **DigitalOcean App Platform** recommended
- Single-click deployment from Git repository
- Managed PostgreSQL database (no manual DB administration)
- Automatic HTTPS and daily backups included
- Cost target: Under $20/month for MVP (hobby tier acceptable)

**Authentication:** Simple username/password with **bcrypt password hashing** for MVP. Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies. OAuth/SSO (Microsoft 365) deferred to post-MVP.

**Xero Integration:** Official Xero API SDK (Node.js or Python) with OAuth 2.0 flow. Store refresh tokens securely (encrypted at rest). Handle token refresh automatically. Research invoice line item limits during technical spike (identified risk in brief).

**Version Control & CI/CD:** Git repository (GitHub/GitLab), automated deployment on merge to main branch, database migrations handled via framework tooling (e.g., Alembic for Python, Sequelize/TypeORM for Node.js).

**Time Entry Storage:** Store time as decimal hours in database for calculation simplicity. Accept flexible input formats in UI, normalize to decimal on save.

**Timezone Handling:**
- All users and clients operate in Central Standard Time (CST/CDT)
- Server should be configured to CST timezone or convert all timestamps to CST for storage
- Work dates (`time_entries.work_date`) stored as DATE type (no time component, eliminates timezone confusion)
- Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `closed_at`) stored in CST
- Date pickers in UI default to CST, no timezone conversion needed
- Month boundaries for invoice generation calculated in CST (e.g., "January 2025" = 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31 CST)

**Rationale:** Single-timezone operation eliminates complexity. All users in same timezone means no conversion logic needed, reducing edge case bugs.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the PRD's User Interface Design Goals section and create detailed wireframes/mockups for the following core screens:

1. Dashboard (home page with open tickets, recently closed, quick stats)
2. Ticket creation form (minimal, speed-optimized)
3. Pre-invoice review screen (grouped by client, inline editing)
4. Ticket detail/edit view

Focus on the "fast-form philosophy" and ensuring <10 second ticket creation workflow. Provide interaction specifications for inline editing and progressive disclosure patterns.

### Architect Prompt

Based on this PRD, create a detailed technical architecture document including:

1. Complete database schema with tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints
2. API endpoint specifications (request/response formats)
3. Xero integration architecture (OAuth flow, token management, invoice generation)
4. Frontend state management approach
5. Soft delete pattern implementation
6. Invoice lock mechanism and transaction handling
7. Time entry parsing and validation logic
8. Deployment architecture and CI/CD pipeline design

Begin with a technical spike on Xero API integration (OAuth flow, "Consulting Services" item usage, invoice creation with line items) using Xero sandbox environment. Document any API limitations or constraints discovered.

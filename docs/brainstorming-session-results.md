- ScreenConnect URL scheme (remote session access)

---

## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: What If Scenarios - Exploring Possibilities (10 min)

**Description:** Provocative questions to explore possibilities without immediate constraints

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Pre-loaded/cached asset data before ticket detail page opens**
   - Small dataset (~300 assets) makes full caching viable
   - Cache invalidation on asset create/update/delete events
   - Could eliminate lookup latency entirely on ticket detail view

2. **Widget/popup/modal on contact selection showing assets with quick actions**
   - Appears when contact is selected (ticket creation or detail view)
   - Three primary quick actions needed:
     - View warranty status (Lenovo API data)
     - Jump to PDQ Connect deploy page
     - Start ScreenConnect remote session
   - Optional: "View full asset details" link
   - Keeps user in flow - no navigation away from ticket

3. **Warranty data is essentially static - no real-time lookups needed**
   - Warranty info rarely changes (customers don't typically extend)
   - When extensions happen, user is involved and can manually update
   - Store warranty data in local DB, eliminate API calls during ticket workflow
   - Possible: Manual "refresh from Lenovo" button on asset edit page only
   - **Performance win:** Zero API latency when viewing assets from tickets

4. **Simple display logic: Most contacts have â‰¤2 assets**
   - Typical case: 1-2 assets per contact (laptops/desktops only)
   - Servers are not contact-assigned (separate tracking)
   - Edge case handling: If >2 assets, show 2 most relevant:
     - Option A: Longest warranty remaining (most valuable assets)
     - Option B: Most recently added to database
   - Always provide "View all assets" link for edge cases
   - **UI win:** Simple, predictable display - no complex filtering needed

**Insights Discovered:**
- Small dataset (300 assets) enables aggressive caching without performance concerns
- Warranty data can be treated as static, eliminating API call latency
- Simple contact-to-asset relationships (1-2 assets typically) means simple UI
- Three critical quick actions identified: warranty view, PDQ link, ScreenConnect launch

**Notable Connections:**
- Static warranty data + small dataset + simple relationships = **potential for instant load times**
- Widget approach keeps user in ticket workflow (no context switching)

---

### Technique 2: First Principles Thinking - Breaking Down Fundamentals (15 min)

**Description:** Strip away assumptions to identify core requirements and essential elements

**Core Problem Identified:**

**"System switching is slow, manual, and creates a negative feedback loop"**

Breaking this down:
1. **Current workflow pain:**
   - Ticket â†’ Notion sheets â†’ ScreenConnect/PDQ
   - Multiple context switches per ticket
   - Manual lookups each time

2. **Compounding problem:**
   - Friction discourages keeping inventory updated
   - Out-of-date inventory creates more friction
   - Negative feedback loop

**Ideas Generated:**

5. **Single-system workflow eliminates context switching**
   - Everything accessible from ticket interface
   - No need to open Notion, ScreenConnect, or PDQ separately
   - Reduces cognitive load and time waste

6. **Integrated system creates positive feedback loop**
   - Easy access to assets makes inventory valuable
   - Valuable inventory incentivizes keeping it updated
   - Updated inventory makes ticket workflow faster
   - Faster workflow reinforces the value

7. **Minimum viable data display - 4 elements only**
   - **Hostname** (asset identifier/name)
   - **Warranty Expiration** (actual date, e.g., "2026-03-15")
   - **PDQ Connect link** (direct to deploy page)
   - **ScreenConnect link** (launch remote session)
   - **Nothing else needed** - keeps UI fast and scannable
   - Optional: Small "view full details" link if more info needed
   - Could add visual indicator (color/icon) if warranty expired or expiring soon

8. **Store all external IDs at asset creation time - zero runtime API calls**
   - **PDQ Connect:**
     - Retrieve `dvc_xxxxx` identifier from PDQ API when asset is created
     - Store in database as `pdq_device_id`
     - Construct URL: `https://app.pdq.com/zero-one-llc/devices/{pdq_device_id}/info`
     - No runtime API call needed - just URL construction
   - **ScreenConnect:**
     - User manually provides `sessionID` (doesn't change once set)
     - Store in database as `screenconnect_session_id`
     - Construct URL: `https://zollc.screenconnect.com/Host#Access///{sessionID}/Join`
     - No API needed at all - purely static URL construction
   - **Performance win:** Both links are instant - just string concatenation

**Insights Discovered:**
- Both PDQ and ScreenConnect can be "set and forget" - IDs stored at asset creation
- Zero runtime API overhead for external integrations
- Only database lookups needed (already cached from idea #1)

9. **Priority feature placement: Asset detail page is MUST, ticket detail is nice-to-have**
   - **MUST work:** Asset detail page
     - Primary use case: viewing full asset information
     - Links to PDQ and ScreenConnect are core functionality here
     - User expects full integration on this page
   - **Nice to have:** Ticket detail page
     - Secondary convenience feature
     - Shows contact's assets with quick links
     - Reduces need to navigate to asset pages
   - **Development strategy:** Build asset detail first, then extend to ticket detail
   - **Inverse of original description!** - Original request focused on ticket detail, but asset detail is the foundation

**Notable Connection:**
- Asset detail page is the source of truth - ticket detail page is just a convenient shortcut to it

---

### Technique 3: Role Playing - Multi-Perspective Views (15 min)

**Description:** Explore the integration from different user perspectives and workflow contexts

**Perspective 1: Primary Technician (Support Role) - Active Troubleshooting**

**Workflow Context Identified:**

**Two distinct ticket creation patterns:**

1. **Outlook Add-in (Post-work logging)**
   - Work already done, just logging time
   - OR capturing email communication for billing
   - No immediate need for asset/remote access

2. **Web Interface (Active support)**
   - On phone with customer, ready to work NOW
   - Need immediate access to their computer
   - Current pain: Finding computer in ScreenConnect is slow

**Ideas Generated:**

10. **Context-aware quick actions based on ticket source**
    - Outlook Add-in tickets: Hide/minimize remote access widgets (not needed)
    - Web interface tickets: Prominent quick-access to ScreenConnect
    - Different UI priorities based on workflow context

11. **Ticket detail page as "mission control" for active support**
    - When creating ticket from web (active support scenario):
    - Show contact's assets immediately upon contact selection
    - One-click ScreenConnect launch - no hunting through SC interface
    - **Time saved:** Eliminates manual search in ScreenConnect every time

12. **Client documentation integration (Notion links)**
    - Each client has Notion documentation page (e.g., Carter Group)
    - Link pattern: `https://www.notion.so/zollc/{client-slug}`
    - Store client-specific Notion URL in Client record
    - Display on ticket detail alongside assets
    - **Expands scope:** Not just asset integration, but full client context integration

**Notable Connection:**
- Ticket creation source (Outlook vs Web) indicates user intent and needed quick actions
- ScreenConnect search elimination is the highest-value time saver for active support

**Perspective 2: Future Self (6 months post-implementation)**

**Must-Have Success Factors:**

13. **ScreenConnect quick access is the killer feature**
    - Single biggest time saver in daily workflow
    - Must be fast and reliable
    - Should work from both ticket detail and asset detail pages

14. **Zero performance impact on ticket creation - CRITICAL**
    - Ticket creation speed cannot be compromised in any way
    - Asset data must load asynchronously or be pre-cached
    - If asset widget is slow, entire integration fails user acceptance test
    - **Implementation note:** Load asset data AFTER ticket form is ready

15. **Graceful handling when contact has no assets**
    - Don't show empty/broken widgets
    - Simple message: "No assets tracked for this contact"
    - Option to add asset or search PDQ for potential matches
    - Never throw errors or show ugly "null" states

**Nice-to-Have Enhancements:**

16. **Intelligent asset discovery from PDQ Connect**
    - When contact has no assets in system, query PDQ for potential matches
    - Match contact name to PDQ "Last User" field:
      - Try: "FirstName LastName"
      - Try: "firstnamelastname"
      - Try: "firstinitiallastname"
    - Present matches for user confirmation/selection
    - User approves match â†’ creates asset record automatically
    - **Value:** Reduces manual asset entry, keeps inventory fresh

17. **Outlook Add-in remains unchanged**
    - Explicit constraint: Do not modify Outlook Add-in workflow
    - It works perfectly as-is
    - Asset integration only in web interface

**Insights Discovered:**
- Performance is binary: either ticket creation is instant, or the feature is a failure
- Asset discovery automation could create positive feedback loop (easier to maintain inventory)
- Graceful degradation is critical for user trust

---

### Technique 4: SCAMPER Method - Systematic Exploration (15 min)

**Description:** Systematic technique using SCAMPER acronym to explore modifications and enhancements

**S - Substitute**

18. **Keep warranty date as-is (not substitution, but confirmation)**
    - Warranty expiration date is preferred format
    - Allows calculation of approximate asset age (warranty + 1 year or + 3 years)
    - Provides forensic value when in-service date is missing
    - No substitution needed

19. **Notion links are one-time setup at client onboarding**
    - Manual entry during client onboarding workflow
    - Low client count makes this manageable
    - Could bulk-add for existing clients as backfill task
    - No automation needed (not enough ROI)

20. **No auto-launching behavior**
    - User wants explicit click control
    - Links should be ready but not intrusive
    - Respects user agency and workflow control

**C - Combine**

21. **"Create Ticket" button from asset detail/list pages**
    - Quick ticket creation when viewing an asset
    - Pre-populates contact information from asset assignment
    - Reverse workflow: asset â†’ ticket (complements ticket â†’ asset)

22. **PDQ asset health/status integration for lifecycle management**
    - NOT needed in ticket workflow area
    - Belongs in asset management section
    - Use PDQ "last seen" date to detect decommissioned assets
    - Helps maintain inventory hygiene (flag stale assets)
    - **Scope:** Asset management feature, not ticket feature

23. **Tickets are contact-centric, not asset-centric**
    - Tickets associate with contacts, not assets
    - "Recent tickets for this asset" doesn't match workflow
    - Could show "recent tickets for this contact" but unclear value
    - **Decision:** Probably not needed

24. **Client Notion documentation link placement on ticket detail**
    - Place in ticket detail page header area
    - Options explored:
      - Inside top "Ticket Information" card (with Client/Contact/Email)
      - To the right of ticket number (#353 area)
    - **Placement priority:** Keep it near client/contact information
    - Should be subtle but always accessible
    - Combines client context with ticket context

**Insights Discovered:**
- Asset â†’ Ticket workflow (create ticket from asset) complements Ticket â†’ Asset workflow
- PDQ health data belongs in asset management, not ticket workflow (separation of concerns)
- Notion link should live in ticket header with other client context

**A - Adapt**

25. **Keep UI simple - don't over-engineer based on other systems**
    - PDQ and ScreenConnect UIs aren't loved by user
    - PDQ has lots of data available, but that doesn't mean it all needs to be shown
    - Stick to minimal viable data (idea #7): Hostname, Warranty, PDQ link, SC link
    - **Principle:** Less is more - show only what's actionable
    - Let PDQ and ScreenConnect handle their complex UIs - just link to them

**Insight:**
- User knows what they need (ideas #7, #14) - trust that simplicity over feature creep

**M - Modify / Magnify**

26. **Color-coded warranty dates for quick visual scanning**
    - Red: Warranty expired
    - Yellow/Amber: Expiring soon (e.g., within 30-90 days)
    - Green: Valid warranty
    - Allows instant assessment without reading dates
    - **Value:** Quick triage - know asset support status at a glance

27. **Minimal widget with link to full asset detail**
    - Widget shows only essential info (hostname, warranty, links)
    - "View full details" link goes to asset detail page
    - No expandable/collapsible complexity needed
    - Keep it simple and predictable

28. **ScreenConnect link: Easy access, not prominent**
    - Don't make it oversized or flashy
    - Just ensure it's clickable and accessible
    - User wants efficiency, not attention-grabbing UI
    - Consistent placement across all asset displays

29. **No recent-access tracking or highlighting**
    - Recently-accessed assets don't provide value
    - Keep display logic simple (most recent by warranty or creation date - idea #4)
    - Avoid unnecessary state tracking

**Insights Discovered:**
- Visual indicators (color) add value; complexity (expandable, highlighting) does not
- "Easy to get to" â‰  "visually prominent" - subtle and efficient is preferred

**P - Put to Other Uses**

30. **Asset age reporting for replacement planning**
    - Report: Assets approaching 5 years old (replacement threshold)
    - Proactive client communication about aging hardware
    - Business value: Plan refresh cycles, budget forecasting for clients
    - Could trigger warranty + purchase date = approximate age calculation

31. **Asset maintenance labor tracking via ticketing integration**
    - When working on asset-related tickets, time is automatically associated with that asset
    - Enables billing clients for asset maintenance/management
    - Shows ROI of keeping asset inventory updated (generates billable time capture)
    - **Key business outcome:** Asset system pays for itself through improved billing

32. **No bulk operations needed**
    - User doesn't foresee need for bulk asset updates
    - Keep operations simple and individual
    - Avoid building unnecessary bulk tooling

**Insights Discovered:**
- Asset integration has BUSINESS VALUE beyond workflow efficiency
- Improved time tracking = better billing = financial justification
- 5-year lifecycle management is a key client service offering
- Positive feedback loop: Better asset tracking â†’ Better time capture â†’ More revenue

**E - Eliminate**

33. **AssetFlow is already lean - no eliminations needed**
    - User designed AssetFlow with only essential data
    - All fields serve a purpose
    - **Validation:** The minimal approach is correct from the start
    - Don't over-think it - bring the AssetFlow data model as-is

**Insight:**
- Starting lean means less refactoring later
- User's instinct for simplicity is proven through multiple technique explorations

**R - Reverse / Rearrange**

34. **Reverse asset onboarding: Start with PDQ + contact, auto-populate everything else**
    - **Traditional flow:** Manually enter asset details
    - **Reversed flow:** Link PDQ device + contact â†’ system fills in the rest
    - **Data sources:**
      - **PDQ Connect API provides:**
        - Manufacturer (e.g., "LENOVO")
        - Model number (e.g., "20Y10017US")
        - Serial number (e.g., "PF2KNMR2")
        - SKU (contains model name, e.g., "ThinkPad P14s Gen 1" at end)
        - Host name (e.g., "LT1.WORKGROUP")
        - Boot time, OS, Memory, etc.
      - **Lenovo Warranty API provides:**
        - Warranty expiration date
        - Warranty length (1-year or 3-year typically)
        - In-service date (calculate backwards: expiration - warranty length)
      - **User provides:**
        - Contact assignment
        - PDQ device selection/confirmation
    - **Parsing logic:**
      - Extract "Model Name" from SKU field (Lenovo only - last part after underscores)
      - Calculate in-service date from warranty data
    - **Value proposition:**
      - Minimal manual entry
      - Data accuracy (source of truth from APIs)
      - Fast onboarding process
      - Automatically maintains sync with PDQ data

35. **Semi-automated asset creation workflow**
    - Step 1: Select contact
    - Step 2: Search/select device from PDQ Connect
    - Step 3: System fetches PDQ data + Lenovo warranty data (if Lenovo)
    - Step 4: Preview auto-populated fields
    - Step 5: User confirms and saves
    - **Result:** Asset created with 90% of data auto-filled

**Insights Discovered:**
- Asset onboarding can be almost entirely automated via API integrations
- PDQ + Lenovo APIs together provide complete asset profile
- User only needs to make the contact â†’ device association
- This eliminates the data entry burden that discourages inventory maintenance (idea #6 feedback loop!)

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Morphological Analysis:** Map all API integration variables (PDQ fields Ã— Lenovo fields Ã— use cases) to find additional automation opportunities
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge assumption that ScreenConnect session IDs must be manual - could they be discovered?
- **Five Whys:** Deep dive on why asset inventory maintenance is neglected currently - may uncover additional friction points

### Questions That Emerged
- What fields does the Lenovo Warranty API actually provide? (Need API documentation)
- Can PDQ Connect API provide real-time device status, or only snapshots?
- Should assets have a "primary/active" flag for contacts with multiple devices?
- How should decommissioned assets be handled? Soft delete or archive?
- Could ScreenConnect API provide session IDs automatically instead of manual entry?
- Should there be asset categories beyond laptop/desktop/server (e.g., printers, network equipment)?
- What's the workflow for transferring an asset from one contact to another?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  - Technical architecture deep-dive for asset integration
  - API integration specifications (PDQ, Lenovo, ScreenConnect)
  - Database schema design workshop
  - UI/UX wireframing session for asset widget
- **Recommended timeframe:** After API documentation review (1-2 weeks)
- **Preparation needed:**
  - Gather PDQ Connect API documentation
  - Obtain Lenovo Warranty API key and documentation
  - Review AssetFlow data model and export sample data
  - Screenshot current ticket detail page for wireframing

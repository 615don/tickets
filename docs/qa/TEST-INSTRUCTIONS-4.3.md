# Test Instructions for Story 4.3

## Automated Tests Added by QA

During the QA review of Story 4.3, comprehensive automated tests were added to ensure the invoice preview endpoint functions correctly and to prevent future regressions.

### Test Files Created

1. **Integration Tests**: `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/invoiceController.test.js`
   - End-to-end testing with real database operations
   - Tests all 10 acceptance criteria
   - Covers complex scenarios with mixed billable/non-billable data

2. **Unit Tests**: `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/invoiceController.groupByClient.test.js`
   - Isolated testing of aggregation logic
   - Tests edge cases and floating-point precision
   - Validates complex multi-client, multi-ticket scenarios

## Running the Tests

### Run All Invoice Controller Tests

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings" node --test backend/src/controllers/__tests__/invoiceController*.test.js
```

### Run Only Integration Tests

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings" node --test backend/src/controllers/__tests__/invoiceController.test.js
```

### Run Only Unit Tests

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings" node --test backend/src/controllers/__tests__/invoiceController.groupByClient.test.js
```

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests Cover:

- ✓ **AC1**: API endpoint exists and responds correctly
- ✓ **AC2**: Response groups tickets by client
- ✓ **AC3**: Total billable hours calculated correctly
- ✓ **AC4**: Missing descriptions flagged
- ✓ **AC5**: Month filtering by work_date
- ✓ **AC6**: Billable-only summation in subtotals
- ✓ **AC7**: Non-billable ticket inclusion
- ✓ **AC8**: Lock status validation
- ✓ **AC9**: Structured response format
- ✓ **AC10**: Authentication requirement

### Specific Test Scenarios:

1. **Mixed billable/non-billable data**
   - Ticket with 3 billable + 1.5 non-billable hours
   - Verifies correct aggregation: totalHours=4.5, billableHours=3.0, nonBillableHours=1.5

2. **Pure billable tickets**
   - Ticket with only billable entries
   - Verifies billable=true, nonBillableHours=0

3. **Pure non-billable tickets**
   - Ticket with only non-billable entries
   - Verifies billable=false, billableHours=0

4. **Multiple clients**
   - Verifies correct grouping and subtotal calculation
   - Client 1: 7.0 billable hours
   - Client 2: 2.5 billable hours
   - Total: 9.5 billable hours

5. **Missing descriptions**
   - Ticket with null description
   - Verifies missingDescription=true flag

6. **Empty months**
   - Month with no time entries
   - Verifies empty clients array and totalBillableHours=0

7. **Locked months**
   - Month with invoice lock created
   - Verifies isLocked=true in response

8. **Month filtering**
   - Time entries in September and October
   - Verifies only September entries included in September preview

9. **Year boundaries**
   - December month request
   - Verifies month boundary calculation handles year rollover

10. **Error handling**
    - Database error simulation
    - Verifies 500 response with standard error format

### Unit Tests Cover:

1. Empty input handling
2. Single client, single ticket scenarios
3. Mixed billable/non-billable aggregation
4. Multiple tickets per client
5. Multiple clients
6. Missing description flag preservation
7. Floating-point precision
8. Complex real-world multi-client scenarios

## Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see output similar to:

```
✔ Invoice Preview Controller - Integration Tests (XXXms)
  ✔ AC1 & AC10: API endpoint exists and requires authentication (XXms)
  ✔ AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7, AC9: Complete invoice preview data structure (XXms)
  ✔ AC5: Month filtering by work_date (XXms)
  ✔ AC8: Invoice lock status validation (XXms)
  ✔ Error handling (XXms)
  ✔ Month boundary edge cases (XXms)

✔ groupByClient - Unit Tests (XXXms)
  ✔ Empty input handling (XXms)
  ✔ Single client, single ticket, single entry (XXms)
  ✔ Mixed billable/non-billable time entries (XXms)
  ✔ Multiple tickets per client (XXms)
  ✔ Multiple clients (XXms)
  ✔ Missing description flag (XXms)
  ✔ Floating point precision (XXms)
  ✔ Complex real-world scenario (XXms)
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure:

1. PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
2. Database schema is up to date (migrations run)
3. Environment variables are configured (.env file)
4. Test database has the necessary tables:
   - clients
   - contacts
   - tickets
   - time_entries
   - invoice_locks

## Notes

- Tests use real database operations and will create/delete test data
- Test data is cleaned up in `after()` hooks
- Tests are isolated and can run in any order
- All tests use the Node.js built-in test runner (no external dependencies)

## QA Review Result

**Gate Status**: ✅ **PASS**

All acceptance criteria verified through automated tests. Story is production-ready.

      refs: ["outlook-addin/src/components/EmailContext.tsx", "outlook-addin/src/App.tsx"]
      rationale: "Current manual testing approach is appropriate for MVP, but automated tests would improve long-term maintainability"

      rationale: "14 lint errors in shadcn/ui components are unrelated to Story 3.4 but should be cleaned up for overall code quality"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Clean component integration with minimal focused changes (replaced HelloWorld with EmailContext in App.tsx)"
  - "Proper data flow architecture: Office.js â†’ useEmailContext hook â†’ App.tsx â†’ Sidebar â†’ EmailContext component"
  - "Excellent component reuse leveraging existing Sidebar, EmailContext, StatusBadge, EmptyState components"
  - "Type-safe implementation with zero TypeScript compilation errors"
  - "Appropriate React hooks usage (useEmailContext for email state, useState for Office initialization)"
  - "Robust error handling for Office.js initialization failures with user-friendly error UI"
  - "useCallback optimization in useEmailContext hook prevents unnecessary event handler re-registration"
  - "Proper cleanup in useEffect return function (removes ItemChanged event handler on unmount)"

  Gate Status: PASS

  Decision Criteria Applied:
  1. Risk Assessment: LOW RISK (no auth/security/payment changes, UI-only integration, < 100 lines changed)
  2. Test Coverage: 8/8 ACs have test coverage via manual testing (appropriate per testing strategy)
  3. NFR Validation: All NFRs PASS (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  4. Code Quality: EXCELLENT (clean integration, proper architecture, type-safe, no refactoring needed)
  5. Compliance: PASS on all standards (coding, architecture, testing, project structure)
  6. Manual Testing: COMPLETED - All 7 test cases PASS (tested 2025-10-10 in Outlook Web)

  No FAIL or CONCERNS issues identified. All technical implementation work complete and meets quality bar.

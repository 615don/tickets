# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All validation implemented: domain format regex, input validation for required fields, parameterized queries prevent SQL injection, proper error handling, transaction isolation, domain normalization"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Batch INSERT optimization implemented (single query for any number of domains), efficient JSON aggregation queries, proper indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried columns"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "ACID transactions with proper rollback, connection leak prevention with finally blocks, cascading deletes preserve integrity, invoice protection prevents data loss, validation before transaction start (fail fast)"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Repository pattern with clean separation, JSDoc documentation for validation functions, consistent query structure, self-documenting validation errors"

# Review history
history:
  - at: "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    note: "Initial review - validation requirements (AC#6) not implemented, N+1 query pattern in domain insertion, missing input validation"
  - at: "2025-09-30T18:00:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    note: "Re-review - all validation fixes implemented (SEC-201, DATA-201, REL-201). Production ready."

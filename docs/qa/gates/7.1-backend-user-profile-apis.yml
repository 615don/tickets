# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security implementation. SQL injection protection via parameterized queries, bcrypt password hashing (SALT_ROUNDS=10), comprehensive password strength validation, session regeneration on credential changes, rate limiting (5 attempts/15min), no password_hash exposure. Security enhancement: Fixed session email injection vulnerability in updatePassword controller."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient database queries with proper indexing, connection pooling enabled, expected <500ms response times achievable. bcrypt computational cost is intentional for security."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling across all code paths, graceful degradation, proper HTTP status codes (400/401/404/500), transaction integrity maintained."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns, self-documenting code, comprehensive test suite serves as documentation, consistent coding style, well-organized file structure."

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Proper separation of concerns (Model → Controller → Route layers)"
    - "Consistent use of parameterized queries throughout (SQL injection protection)"
    - "Password strength validation integrated at model layer"
    - "Session management follows security best practices"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage: 24/24 tests passing (10 unit + 14 integration)"
    - "Excellent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes"
    - "No password_hash exposure to frontend"
    - "Regression tests ensure no breaking changes to existing auth flow"

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "AES-256-GCM encryption, proper key management, API key masking, authentication required on all endpoints, comprehensive input validation"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Singleton pattern ensures fast single-row lookups, AES-256-GCM hardware-accelerated, no N+1 queries, uses existing connection pool"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling on encryption failures, idempotent migration with ON CONFLICT, PostgreSQL CHECK constraint enforces singleton"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code documentation with JSDoc, follows InvoiceConfig singleton pattern, 100% test coverage for critical paths, clear separation of concerns"

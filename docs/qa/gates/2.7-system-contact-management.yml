# Quality Gate Decision for Story 2.7: System Contact Management
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.7"
story_title: "System Contact Management"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "AC#1-5 fully implemented with excellent transaction management and data integrity. AC#6 appropriately deferred to future epic. No blocking issues identified."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

    monitor:
      - "Add integration tests for deletion transaction before Epic 3"
      - "Implement audit trail (AC#6) in future epic as documented"
      - "Consider database index on is_system_contact when scale increases"

# Quality scoring

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "System contact deletion blocked at model layer, parameterized queries prevent SQL injection, proper HTTP 403 status"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bulk UPDATE for ticket reassignment, single query for system contact lookup, transaction keeps locks minimal"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transaction atomicity with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, connection properly released, error handling prevents partial state"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean model/controller separation, get-or-create pattern is idiomatic, JSDoc comments, descriptive names"

# Technical debt identified
technical_debt:
  - id: "TEST-002"
    category: "Testing"
    description: "No automated tests for critical deletion transaction with ticket reassignment"
    impact: "Medium - regression risk for data integrity operations"

  - id: "FEATURE-001"
    category: "Feature Completeness"
    description: "AC#6 (audit trail for original contact names) deferred"
    impact: "Medium - cannot show historical contact info in ticket views"

  - id: "CONSISTENCY-001"
    category: "Naming"
    description: "Backend uses '(Deleted Contact)', UI badge shows 'System'"

    description: "No index on is_system_contact column"

    severity: high
    finding: "Three of four badge variants failed WCAG AA contrast requirements (matched: 2.30:1, warning: 2.13:1, loading: 3.64:1 vs required 4.5:1)"
    suggested_action: "Fixed during QA review by adjusting HSL lightness values in index.css. All badges now pass with 4.83-4.87:1 ratios."

    severity: medium
    finding: "No automated tests for UI components - relies entirely on manual testing"

  - id: "MANUAL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Manual testing not yet performed - cannot verify 500ms performance target, visual appearance, or tooltip functionality"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - purely presentational UI components"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Cannot verify 500ms visual feedback target without manual testing. React render time expected <100ms based on component simplicity, but needs verification."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling delegated to parent components. Badge rendering is stateless and deterministic."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component architecture, good separation of concerns, tooltip implementation uses native HTML for simplicity"
  accessibility:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "WCAG AA violations fixed during review (matched, warning, loading badges). Neutral badge passed originally. tabIndex={0} correctly added for keyboard navigation. Requires manual verification."

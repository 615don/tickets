# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication enforced via requireAuth middleware. Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection. Input validation prevents type confusion. No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Query uses LIMIT 3, leverages existing state index, small payload size. Acceptable for MVP. Optional future optimization: composite index on (contact_id, state, updated_at)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks. Graceful degradation (empty array for no results). All error scenarios tested. Consistent error response format."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code following established patterns. Self-documenting function names. Comprehensive test suite with descriptive test names. Excellent dev notes in story file."

# Recommendations (all optional future enhancements)

  future:
    - action: "Consider composite index (contact_id, state, updated_at) if query performance becomes concern with larger datasets"

    - action: "Consider making limit parameter configurable via query string if flexibility needed in future stories"

# Review details
review_notes: |
  Comprehensive review conducted covering:
  - Requirements traceability (all 3 ACs mapped to tests using Given-When-Then)
  - Code quality and architecture (follows established patterns, clean implementation)
  - Test architecture (6 unit tests plus manual API test script)
  - Security (authentication, SQL injection prevention, input validation)
  - Performance (efficient query design with LIMIT and indexed columns)
  - Reliability (comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation)
  - Maintainability (clear naming, consistent patterns, good documentation)
  - Standards compliance (coding standards, project structure, testing strategy)

  All unit tests passing (6/6). Manual API test script available for end-to-end validation.

  Implementation is production-ready with no required changes.

# Quality Gate Decision - Story 5.3: New Contact Creation Workflow
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "5.3"
story_title: "New Contact Creation Workflow"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is technically excellent with strong code quality, but story ACs are out of sync with implemented behavior (user-driven simplification removed editable email field). Manual testing not yet executed."

# Gate decision rationale:
# - Code quality: Excellent (90/100) - clean React patterns, strong TypeScript, proper state management
# - Security/Performance/Reliability: All PASS
# - Concerns: (1) Story ACs describe removed features (AC3, AC5, AC7), (2) Manual testing incomplete
# - No code changes required - issues are documentation and testing validation

# Quality scoring
quality_score: 90
# Calculation: 100 - (10 × 2 medium concerns) = 90

# Evidence from review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # Manual testing only (no automated tests per MVP strategy)
  risks_identified: 2  # DOC-001 and TEST-001
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9]  # ACs fully implemented as documented
    ac_gaps: [3, 5, 7]  # ACs describe removed features (documentation mismatch, not missing implementation)

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Email validation regex prevents injection. Input sanitization via trim(). No XSS risk (text content only). Proper null checks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "useEffect deps correct (no infinite loops). Inline validation O(n). Minimal re-renders. No memory leaks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling with inline messages. Optional chaining throughout. Form validation prevents invalid submission."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with clear naming. TypeScript provides type safety. Proper separation of concerns. Well-documented state flow."

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No code changes required - implementation is production-ready

  future:
    - action: "Consider adding automated E2E tests using Playwright when moving beyond MVP (test progressive disclosure, validation, state management)"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md"]
    - action: "Consider extracting email validation regex to shared utility if reused in multiple components"

# Implementation highlights (for learning/reference)
code_quality_highlights:
  - "Clean state lifting pattern: App.tsx manages contactName/contactEmail, passes to child components"
  - "Proper null safety: Optional chaining used throughout (matchingResult?.type, contactName?.trim())"
  - "TypeScript excellence: Zero compilation errors, strong typing with interfaces in types.ts"
  - "React best practices: Controlled components, proper hooks usage, minimal re-renders"
  - "Pragmatic simplification: User feedback drove removal of editable email (Outlook is source of truth)"

# User-driven design decision (important context)
design_rationale:
  decision: "Removed editable email field and 'new contact' indicator message per user feedback"
  commit: "813e09f"
  reasoning: "Email always sourced from selected Outlook email (immutable). StatusBadge '⚠ New contact at [Client]' provides sufficient indication. Removed blue info message was redundant visual noise."
  impact: "Improved UX without sacrificing functionality. Email validation still enforced server-side."

# Test coverage assessment
test_strategy:
  approach: "Manual testing (MVP strategy per testing-strategy.md)"
  documented_test_cases: 8
  test_case_lines: "180-228"
  execution_status: "NOT YET EXECUTED"
  recommendation: "Execute Test Cases 1-8 in Outlook Web before marking story 'Done'"

# Evidence from review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # Manual testing only (no automated tests for deployment)
  manual_tests_completed: 7  # Tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "HTTPS with Let's Encrypt verified. CORS whitelist configured. Session cookies secure (httpOnly, sameSite=none with CSRF protection). No secrets in code. Minor CSRF risk acknowledged and mitigated."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized Vite build (146 kB JS gzipped). Static serving via Railway. <5 min deployment time. Zero-downtime deploys."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Isolated failure domain (add-in service independent). Railway rollback capability documented. Error handling for SSL cert loading."
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Outstanding documentation (README covers dev, prod, troubleshooting). Clear separation of dev vs. prod manifests. Auto-deploy on main branch."

# Risk summary

    monitor:
      - "External icon dependency (placehold.co) - consider self-hosting in future branding story"

# Recommendations for improvement

# Review highlights
highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Zero-downtime deployment strategy with Railway service isolation"
    - "Elegant manifest hosting via Vite public/ directory pattern"
    - "Production-ready CORS with multi-origin array and credentials support"
    - "Exceptional documentation quality (production installation, troubleshooting, maintainer guide)"
    - "Iterative improvement mindset (manifest refined post-testing)"
    - "Defensive configuration (conditional SSL cert loading prevented build failures)"
  concerns:
    - "CSRF risk from SameSite=None (MITIGATED: existing csurf middleware provides protection per security-integration.md)"
    - "External dependency for icons (LOW PRIORITY: placehold.co service for non-critical visual assets)"
  testing_notes:
    - "Manual testing appropriate for deployment story (no testable business logic)"
    - "User acceptance testing completed successfully in production"
    - "All 9 acceptance criteria validated through real Outlook Web environment"
    - "Edge cases covered: SSL cert missing, MIME type incorrect, CORS errors, manifest validation, Add from URL unavailable"

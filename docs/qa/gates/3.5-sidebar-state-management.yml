nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns - state infrastructure only, no data access or user input handling'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minimal state overhead, efficient re-rendering, state reset prevents memory leaks. User confirmed no performance issues during rapid email switching.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'State reset logic prevents stale data, TypeScript null safety, no console errors reported'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional documentation quality - comprehensive Dev Notes, JSDoc comments, state lifecycle diagram, architecture decision rationale, future refactoring path documented'

recommendations:
  immediate: [] # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: 'Consider React Context refactor if component tree grows >3 levels in Epic 5'
      refs: ['outlook-addin/src/App.tsx']
      rationale: 'Current App.tsx lifting state is appropriate for Epic 3 (2 levels), but deeper nesting may warrant Context API'
    - action: 'Add React Testing Library tests in Epic 5 when form state interactions become complex'
      refs: ['docs/outlook-addin/stories/3.5.sidebar-state-management.story.md']
      rationale: 'Manual testing sufficient for infrastructure story, but future state interactions may benefit from automated tests'

highlights:
  strengths:
    - 'Appropriate architecture decision - App.tsx lifting state correct for Epic 3 shallow component tree'
    - 'Comprehensive TypeScript types with JSDoc comments'
    - 'State reset logic properly uses useEffect dependency array'
    - 'Exceptional documentation - state lifecycle, architecture rationale, future refactoring path'
    - 'User confirmed manual testing passed: state persistence, email switching, no console errors'
  observations:
    - 'Visual output identical to Story 3.4 (expected for infrastructure-only story)'
    - 'isSubmitting state intentionally unused until Epic 5 (appropriately documented with eslint-disable)'
    - 'State setters not exposed to child components (good - prevents inappropriate mutations)'

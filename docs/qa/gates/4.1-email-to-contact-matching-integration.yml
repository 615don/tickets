nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Session-based auth properly implemented with credentials: 'include'. URI encoding prevents injection. No hardcoded secrets. HTTPS enforced on Railway deployment."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "300ms debounce prevents excessive API calls. AbortController cancels in-flight requests. StatusBadge updates < 500ms per NFR2 target. No lag observed in production testing."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation to manual mode on API failures. Race conditions prevented via AbortController. Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code architecture with service layer pattern. Strong TypeScript typing. Comprehensive JSDoc and inline comments. Well-organized Dev Notes."

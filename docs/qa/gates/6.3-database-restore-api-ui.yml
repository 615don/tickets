  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "After fix - Authentication enforced, CSRF protected, file validation comprehensive, shell injection prevented via execFile()"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "5-minute timeout appropriate, 50MB buffer adequate, 100MB file limit prevents resource exhaustion"

    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []  # All critical issues resolved
    monitor:
      - "Consider adding rate limiting to restore endpoint (similar to backup generation)"
      - "Consider audit logging for restore operations"
      - "Ensure environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER) are set securely in production"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues - all resolved
  future:
    - action: "Add rate limiting to restore endpoint to prevent abuse (1 restore per hour per user)"

# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All security vulnerabilities resolved. Session regeneration prevents fixation attacks. Rate limiting (5/15min) prevents brute force. Constant-time verification prevents user enumeration. CSRF protection implemented. Strong foundations maintained: bcrypt hashing, HTTP-only cookies, input validation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bcrypt rounds (10) well-balanced. React Query caching (5min) efficient. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection. No N+1 issues. Rate limiting improves DoS resilience without performance impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling including new security features. Session persistence in PostgreSQL. Graceful handling of edge cases (deleted users, rate limit exceeded, session regeneration failures). Frontend loading states. Proper async error propagation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean MVC architecture maintained. Consistent error format. Reusable validation and rate limiting middleware. TypeScript on frontend. React Query industry standard. Security fixes well-documented and follow best practices."

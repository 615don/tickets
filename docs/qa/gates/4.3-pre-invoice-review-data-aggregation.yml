  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SQL injection protection via parameterized queries, authentication enforced, comprehensive input validation, no sensitive data exposure"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses indexed work_date column, single query with JOINs eliminates N+1, appropriate for MVP scale (1-2 users). Scalability consideration noted for high-volume production use."

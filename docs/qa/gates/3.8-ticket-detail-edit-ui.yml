      priority: low
      refs:
        - "frontend/src/hooks/useTimeEntries.ts"

      priority: low

        - "frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.tsx:279-354"
      rationale: "Performance optimization for tickets with 50+ time entries (unlikely in MVP)"

# Architecture Review
architecture:
  patterns_followed:
    - "Service layer abstraction (tickets.ts + time-entries.ts)"
    - "React Query for state management and caching"
    - "Component composition (TicketDetail → TimeEntryRow, TicketActions, EditableTextField)"
    - "Type safety with TypeScript interfaces"
    - "CSRF protection via centralized apiClient"
    - "Responsive design (desktop/mobile patterns)"

  strengths:
    - "Excellent API layer separation - time entries in dedicated module"
    - "Comprehensive React Query integration with proper cache invalidation"
    - "Clean component composition with single responsibility"
    - "Type safety throughout with accurate snake_case ↔ camelCase transformations"
    - "Business logic correctness (locked entries, canReopen visibility)"
    - "Polished UX with inline editing, confirmations, feedback messages"
    - "Accessibility via semantic HTML and shadcn/ui components"
    - "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages"

  tech_debt:
    - severity: low
      issue: "No automated tests (expected per MVP testing-strategy.md)"
      impact: "Regression risk when modifying inline editing or time entry logic"

    - severity: very-low
      issue: "formatDuration() duplicated in two components"
      impact: "Minor code duplication, not a functional concern"

    - severity: very-low
      issue: "No optimistic updates for mutations"
      impact: "Minor UX enhancement opportunity, current approach is fine"

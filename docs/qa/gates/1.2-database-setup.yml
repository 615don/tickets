# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All security concerns resolved. Graceful error handling (no DoS via process exit), environment-aware query logging (no sensitive data leakage), sanitized health endpoint responses. No hardcoded credentials. Helmet enabled."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Connection pooling properly configured (max: 20, idle: 30s, timeout: 2s). Query timing instrumentation present. Efficient indexing in migrations."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Migrations are transactional and idempotent. Connection retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s). Graceful degradation on database errors. No fatal exits."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns, consistent style, excellent documentation with JSDoc. Custom migration system is simple and maintainable."

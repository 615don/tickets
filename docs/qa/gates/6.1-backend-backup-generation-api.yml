# Quality Gate: 6.1 Backend Backup Generation API

schema: 1
story: "6.1"
story_title: "Backend Backup Generation API"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is functionally complete with excellent error handling. AC7 wording needs correction (remove 'admin' - all authenticated users intended). Rate limiting recommended before production."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "AC7 wording mismatch - states 'admin users' but requirement is 'all authenticated users' (clarified by stakeholder)"
    suggested_action: "Update AC7 to read 'Only authenticated users can trigger backup generation' (remove 'admin')"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Test quality issue - tests are documentation-style assertions without mocking actual function execution"
    suggested_action: "Add integration tests with mocked child_process, fs, and archiver to verify actual code paths"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    refs: ["backend/src/controllers/__tests__/backupController.test.js:1-259"]

  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No rate limiting on backup endpoint - allows potential DoS via expensive pg_dump operations"
    suggested_action: "Add rate limiting middleware (e.g., 1 backup per 5 minutes per user)"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    refs: ["backend/src/routes/backup.js:8"]

  - id: "STD-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Direct process.env access violates coding standard (should use config)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Authentication correctly implemented for all authenticated users (AC7 clarified - implementation matches intent). Missing rate limiting creates DoS risk. CSRF protection verified. Environment sanitization implemented correctly. Backup file contains sensitive credentials (by design but should warn users)."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "5-minute timeout configured. 50MB maxBuffer for large databases. Streaming response prevents disk usage. Blocking pg_dump operation acceptable for manual admin task."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all pg_dump failure modes. Automatic cleanup on success and error paths. Clear user-friendly error messages. Cleanup failure monitoring recommended."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with separation of concerns. Good inline documentation. Standard error format. Follows project patterns (mostly - process.env exception noted)."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transaction-based ticket creation ensures atomicity, comprehensive error handling, CSRF retry logic, backend rollback on errors"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS

# Architecture Review
architecture:
  patterns_followed:
    - "Service layer abstraction (frontend/src/lib/api/tickets.ts)"
    - "React Query for state management"
    - "Component separation (Page → Form)"
    - "Type safety with TypeScript interfaces"
    - "CSRF protection via centralized apiClient"

  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns"
    - "Proper snake_case ↔ camelCase transformation"
    - "Timezone-aware date handling with getTodayLocalDate()"
    - "React hooks with imperative handles for form control"
    - "Transaction-based backend ensures data integrity"

  tech_debt:
    - severity: low
      issue: "No automated tests (expected per MVP testing-strategy.md)"
      impact: "Regression risk when modifying time parsing or form logic"

    - severity: low
      issue: "Time parsing logic duplicated between frontend and backend"
      impact: "Risk of divergence in validation rules"

# Review Summary
summary: |
  Excellent implementation with clean architecture and strong adherence to established patterns.
  Code demonstrates mature TypeScript/React practices with proper use of React Query.
  All 12 acceptance criteria validated. Security, performance, and reliability requirements met.
  One navigation bug fixed during review - form now properly navigates to ticket detail page.
  No blocking issues identified. Ready for Done status.

  Key Strengths:
  - Clean API service layer following established patterns
  - Proper transformation between snake_case and camelCase
  - Excellent React hooks usage with imperative handles
  - CSRF protection properly implemented
  - Timezone-aware date handling
  - Transaction-based backend ensures data integrity

  Minor Technical Debt (Non-blocking):
  - No automated tests (expected per MVP testing strategy)
  - Time parsing logic duplicated between frontend/backend

  Recommendation: PASS - Ready for Done

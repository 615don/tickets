# Non-Functional Requirements validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Audit logging captures all credential changes (success/failure). Rate limiting configured correctly (5 attempts/15min). Session invalidation working. IP tracking functional. No sensitive data in logs."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async audit logging prevents blocking. Database indexes on user_id, timestamp, action. No N+1 queries. Test suite executes in ~30s. Graceful error handling prevents cascade failures."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Graceful degradation if audit logging fails. Database transaction safety. Session management handles edge cases. Foreign key constraints prevent data integrity issues."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Self-documenting code with clear function names. JSDoc on public functions. Test names serve as living documentation. Clean separation of concerns. Follows established project patterns."
  testability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "48 tests with 100% pass rate. Excellent test isolation. Edge cases well covered (IPv6, error handling, FK violations). Documentation tests explain architectural decisions."

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story demonstrates exceptional software engineering quality across all evaluated dimensions:

  SECURITY: Comprehensive audit logging implementation with proper error handling, rate limiting
  verification, and session invalidation. All security measures tested and working correctly.

  TESTING: 48 tests with 100% pass rate covering success paths, failure scenarios, edge cases,
  and security concerns. Test architecture shows clear separation of concerns (unit vs integration).
  Documentation tests explain architectural decisions.

  CODE QUALITY: Clean, well-documented code following established patterns. Single-responsibility
  principle applied. Proper error handling with graceful degradation. JSDoc documentation present.

  COMPLIANCE: Fully compliant with coding standards, project structure, and testing strategy.
  Migration follows established conventions. All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive evidence.

  RISK: Zero critical, high, or medium risks. Low overall risk with only minor operational
  considerations for future production scaling.

  The implementation is production-ready and requires no changes before marking the story as Done.

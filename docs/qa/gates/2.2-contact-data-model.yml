# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All validation implemented: name validation (required, max 255), email format regex, client ID validation, parameterized queries prevent SQL injection, system contact protection, proper error handling"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns, partial unique index optimized for soft delete pattern, no N+1 issues, efficient JOINs, validation before transaction start (fail fast)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transactional soft delete with ticket reassignment, proper error handling with rollback, client release in finally blocks, cascading deletes preserve integrity, system contact creation ensures referential integrity, cannot delete system contacts"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Repository pattern with clean separation, JSDoc documentation for validation functions, consistent query structure, reusable validation helpers, self-documenting validation errors"

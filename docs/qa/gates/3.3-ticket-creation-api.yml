schema: 1
story: "3.3"
story_title: "Ticket Creation API Endpoint"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation functional but has redundant code removed during review. Contact model lacks camelCase consistency with other models."

top_issues:
  - id: "TECH-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Redundant duration parsing in controller when TimeEntry.create() already handles it"
    suggested_action: "FIXED - Removed duplicate parseTimeEntry import and validation from controller"
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Contact model returns snake_case (client_id) while Ticket/TimeEntry models return camelCase (clientId)"
    suggested_action: "Consider standardizing Contact model to return camelCase for consistency"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "No automated tests for ticket creation endpoint - only manual testing documented"
    suggested_action: "Add integration tests for POST /api/tickets covering all acceptance criteria"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication required via requireAuth middleware. Input validation prevents injection. Transactions ensure data integrity."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transaction-based atomic operation is appropriate. Single round trip to database."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transaction rollback on error ensures data consistency. Error handling covers all failure modes."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Model inconsistency (snake_case vs camelCase) creates technical debt. Code is otherwise clear and well-structured."

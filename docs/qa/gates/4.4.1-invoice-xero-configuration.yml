# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation that sets the standard for configuration management
  in this codebase. Key excellence indicators:

  1. **Database Design:** Singleton table with CHECK constraints is textbook-perfect for
     system-wide configuration. The constraints prevent data corruption at the lowest level.

  2. **Testing Innovation:** Uses Node 20.4+ mock.timers API for date-dependent tests,
     demonstrating modern JavaScript testing practices. Database constraint tests ensure
     integrity guarantees work as designed.

  3. **Full-Stack Integration:** Seamlessly integrates backend (model, controller, routes),
     database (migration, constraints), and frontend (hooks, UI, React Query).

  4. **Zero Technical Debt:** No shortcuts, no deferred work, no missing tests. Production-ready.

  5. **Performance:** Configuration check adds <2ms to invoice generation, negligible impact.

  6. **Defense in Depth:** Three layers of validation (UI, app, database) ensure invalid
     states are impossible.

  The implementation quality here is exceptional and should be used as a reference for
  future configuration-related features.

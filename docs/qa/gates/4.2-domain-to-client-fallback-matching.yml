decision_rationale: |
  Gate set to PASS after QA refactoring resolved PERF-001:

  **Resolved During Review:**
  - ✅ **PERF-001 (AbortController):** Fixed by adding optional signal parameter to API functions
    and passing abortController.signal in hook. All 29 tests still pass, TypeScript compiles
    without errors. Backward compatible change (signal is optional).

  **Accepted with Mitigation:**
  - ✓ **TEST-001 (Hook integration tests):** Intentional deferral documented in Task 9. Sequential
    logic validated through extensive manual testing (TC1-TC7 with Network tab inspection). Unit
    tests cover all individual functions comprehensively. Risk mitigated, acceptable for release.

  Story is production-ready:
  - All 9 acceptance criteria met and validated
  - 29 unit tests pass with excellent edge case coverage
  - Manual testing 6/7 full pass + 1/7 partial pass (TC5: auth UX deferred to Story 4.3)
  - AbortController optimization implemented (PERF-001 resolved)
  - Code quality excellent, follows established patterns
  - Security, performance, reliability, maintainability all PASS

  **Decision:** Owner chose Option B - QA fixed AbortController during review. Story ready for Done.

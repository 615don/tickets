  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-layer validation (route + model), parameterized queries, authentication enforced, system contact protection (403), transaction isolation - excellent security posture"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper indexes, efficient JOINs, no N+1 issues, optimized query patterns, transaction management efficient - production-ready for expected scale"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Transaction rollback on errors, system contact auto-creation prevents orphaned tickets, ticket reassignment ensures integrity, comprehensive error handling - highly reliable"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code reuse (leverages validated Contact model from Story 2.2), repository pattern, JSDoc comments, consistent conventions, reusable methods - highly maintainable"

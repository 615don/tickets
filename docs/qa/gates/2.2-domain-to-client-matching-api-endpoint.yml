# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication enforced via requireAuth middleware. SQL injection prevented through parameterized queries. Input validation using express-validator with domain format regex. No security concerns identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient CTE-based SQL query with proper indexing opportunity on client_domains.domain. Single JOIN operation avoids N+1 queries. Response payload minimal (~200 bytes typical). Expected query time <10ms with indexing."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try/catch. Returns appropriate status codes (200 for success/no-match, 400 for validation, 500 for server errors). Empty array on no match prevents null reference errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear code structure following existing patterns. Well-documented with inline comments. Comprehensive test suite (10 tests) ensures regression protection. Response structure aliases company_name to 'name' for API clarity."

# Test Coverage Summary

# Technical Debt Assessment
technical_debt:
  introduced: "None - follows existing patterns cleanly"
  addressed: "None applicable"

# Code Quality Observations
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Excellent SQL design using CTE pattern for clarity and performance"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage exceeding requirements (10 tests vs minimum 4)"
    - "Proper security implementation (parameterized queries, authentication, input validation)"
    - "Clean error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes"
    - "Case-insensitive matching properly implemented with LOWER() function"
    - "Response structure consistent with existing API patterns"

  minor_notes:
    - "Domain normalization occurs in both controller and SQL query (defensive but slightly redundant)"
    - "Test cleanup uses both beforeEach and afterEach (thorough but could be streamlined)"

# Acceptance Criteria Validation
acceptance_criteria_status:
  total: 10
  passed: 10
  failed: 0
  notes: "AC#4 adapted to reflect database UNIQUE constraint on client_domains.domain - business rule correctly enforces one domain per client at database level"

# Standards Compliance

# Additional Notes
notes: |
  Story 2.2 demonstrates excellent development practices:

  1. **Discovery During Development**: Team correctly identified database UNIQUE constraint
     on client_domains.domain and adapted AC#4 accordingly. This is good engineering practice.

  2. **Test Quality**: 10 comprehensive unit tests covering:
     - Exact matching (AC#2)
     - Case-insensitive matching (AC#7)
     - Unique domain constraint (adapted AC#4)
     - No match scenario (AC#5)
     - Domain aggregation (AC#3)
     - Subdomain exact matching behavior
     - Response structure validation (AC#3)
     - Edge cases (hyphens, multi-level TLDs, numbers)

  3. **SQL Best Practices**:
     - CTE (Common Table Expression) pattern improves query readability
     - Aggregates ALL domains for matched client (not just queried domain)
     - Provides full context for Outlook add-in use case

  4. **API Design Consistency**:
     - Follows established pattern from Story 2.1
     - Empty array on no match (not 404)
     - Proper error responses with clear messages

  5. **Manual Testing**: Developer created comprehensive manual test script
     demonstrating real-world usage scenarios.

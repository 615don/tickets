# Story 3.1: Ticket Data Model & Database Schema

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** database tables and models for storing ticket and time entry information,
**so that** the application can persist ticket data with appropriate relationships and constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database migration creates `tickets` table with columns: `id`, `client_id` (FK), `contact_id` (FK), `description` (nullable), `notes` (nullable), `state` (enum: open/closed), `closed_at` (nullable), `created_at`, `updated_at`
2. Database migration creates `time_entries` table with columns: `id`, `ticket_id` (FK), `work_date`, `duration_hours` (decimal), `billable` (boolean), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (nullable)
3. Foreign key constraints enforce valid client_id and contact_id references
4. Cascading rules defined for ticket deletion (cascade delete time_entries)
5. Backend models/entities created for Ticket and TimeEntry with appropriate types
6. Model validation rules defined (e.g., duration_hours > 0, work_date not future)
7. Index created on `tickets.state` for efficient filtering
8. Index created on `time_entries.work_date` for date-range queries
9. Migration runs successfully and can be rolled back

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Test duration_hours validation (reject 0, negative, > 24)
  - [x] Test work_date future validation
  - [x] Verify indexes exist using \d+ tickets and \d+ time_entries in psql

## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL: Migrations Already Exist
**IMPORTANT**: The `tickets` and `time_entries` tables were created in the initial migration system (`backend/src/utils/migrate.js`). These migrations (005_create_tickets_table and 006_create_time_entries_table) already exist and have been run. **DO NOT create new migrations** - this story focuses on:
1. Verifying existing migrations meet AC requirements
2. Creating the backend model layer (Ticket.js and TimeEntry.js)
3. Testing the schema and models work correctly

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#ticket]
```typescript
export interface Ticket {
  id: number;
  clientId: number;
  clientName?: string; // Populated via JOIN
  contactId: number;
  contactName?: string; // Populated via JOIN
  description: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
  state: 'open' | 'closed';

```

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#timeentry]

export interface TimeEntry {
  id: number;
  ticketId: number;
  workDate: string; // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  durationHours: number; // Decimal hours
  billable: boolean;
  deletedAt: string | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

export interface TimeEntryRequest {
  workDate: string;
  duration: string; // Flexible format, parsed on backend
  billable: boolean;
}
```

### Model Implementation Guidance

**Repository Pattern**:
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- Backend uses Repository Pattern for data access layer
- Models abstract database operations and contain business logic
- Models export object with methods for CRUD operations (see existing Client.js, Contact.js)
- Reference existing models: `backend/src/models/Client.js`, `backend/src/models/Contact.js`

**Column Name Conversion**:
- Database columns use snake_case (e.g., `client_id`, `contact_id`, `duration_hours`)
- JavaScript/TypeScript uses camelCase (e.g., `clientId`, `contactId`, `durationHours`)
- Models must handle conversion in query results (SQL uses snake_case, returned objects use camelCase)
- Example: `SELECT client_id, contact_id FROM tickets` â†’ return `{ clientId, contactId }`

**Key Model Methods to Implement**:

**Ticket Model** (`backend/src/models/Ticket.js`):
```javascript
export const Ticket = {
  async create({ clientId, contactId, description, notes, state = 'open' }) { ... },
  async findAll({ state, clientId } = {}) { ... },
  async findById(id) { ... },
  async update(id, { description, notes, state }) { ... },
  async deleteTicket(id) { ... }
}
```

**TimeEntry Model** (`backend/src/models/TimeEntry.js`):
```javascript
export const TimeEntry = {
  async create({ ticketId, workDate, durationHours, billable = true }) { ... },
  async findByTicketId(ticketId) { ... },
  async update(id, { workDate, durationHours, billable }) { ... },
  async softDelete(id) { ... }
}
```

### Validation Rules
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**Ticket Validation**:
- `clientId`: Required, must reference existing client
- `contactId`: Required, must reference existing contact
- `description`: Optional (nullable)
- `notes`: Optional (nullable)
- `state`: Required, must be 'open' or 'closed', defaults to 'open'
- `closedAt`: Automatically set when state changes to 'closed', cleared when re-opened

**TimeEntry Validation**:
- `ticketId`: Required, must reference existing ticket
- `workDate`: Required, must be DATE format, cannot be in future
- `durationHours`: Required, must be > 0 and <= 24 (enforced by DB CHECK constraint)
- `billable`: Required, must be boolean, defaults to true
- `deletedAt`: Nullable, set by soft delete (audit trail per NFR9)

### Database Relationships
[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

**Foreign Keys**:
- `tickets.client_id` â†’ `clients.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `tickets.contact_id` â†’ `contacts.id` (no cascade, contact soft delete reassigns to system contact)
- `time_entries.ticket_id` â†’ `tickets.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

**Cascade Behavior**:
- Deleting a client cascades to tickets and time_entries
- Deleting a ticket cascades to time_entries
- Deleting a contact does NOT cascade (handled in application logic - Story 2.7)

### Soft Delete Pattern (NFR9 Audit Trail)
[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#key-schema-features]
- Time entries use soft delete via `deleted_at` timestamp
- Soft deleted records remain in database for audit trail
- Query filters must exclude soft deleted records: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
- Soft delete method sets `deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

### Testing

**Testing Strategy**: Manual testing for MVP
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Run `npm run migrate` - verify migrations are idempotent
- [x] Create ticket with valid client_id and contact_id - verify success
- [x] Create ticket with invalid client_id - verify foreign key error
- [x] Create ticket without description/notes - verify optional fields work
- [x] Update ticket state to 'closed' - verify closed_at timestamp set
- [x] Create time entry with duration 1.5 hours - verify decimal storage
- [x] Create time entry with duration 0 hours - verify CHECK constraint rejection
- [x] Create time entry with duration 25 hours - verify CHECK constraint rejection
- [x] Create time entry with future work_date - verify validation rejection
- [x] Soft delete time entry - verify deleted_at timestamp set
- [x] Query time entries - verify soft deleted entries excluded
- [x] Delete ticket - verify time_entries cascade deleted
- [x] Query tickets filtered by state='open' - verify index used (check EXPLAIN plan)
- [x] Query time_entries filtered by work_date range - verify index used

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.**

Key security features properly implemented:
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Existence validation before FK operations
- Input sanitization via validation functions
- Type checking on all inputs
- Database-level constraints as final safeguard

### Performance Considerations

**No performance issues identified.**

Optimizations already in place:
- Indexes on all foreign keys (idx_tickets_client_id, idx_tickets_contact_id, idx_time_entries_ticket_id)
- Indexes on filter columns (idx_tickets_state, idx_time_entries_work_date)
- Indexes on soft delete column (idx_time_entries_deleted_at)
- Efficient aggregation using SUM with FILTER clause
- Proper use of GROUP BY for aggregated queries

**Minor Future Optimization (Not Blocking):**
Consider adding composite index on time_entries(ticket_id, deleted_at) for frequently joined queries, but current performance is acceptable for MVP scale.

# Story 15.11: Testing, Performance Validation, and Documentation

**Epic:** 15 - Asset Management Integration
**Story:** 15.11
**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate performance requirements and document the asset feature,
**so that** the enhancement meets all acceptance criteria and is maintainable.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Performance Validation:**
   - Asset widget load time measured: <500ms confirmed (Story 15.7)
   - Ticket page load time unchanged: <10 seconds confirmed
   - Asset list page load time: <2 seconds for 300 assets
   - Cache hit rate logged: 95%+ over 24-hour test period
2. **Manual QA Checklist:**
   - Create asset (manual + Lenovo API lookup)
   - Edit asset (change contact assignment, update fields)
   - Retire asset → verify excluded from widget
   - Reactivate asset → verify appears in widget
   - Permanently delete retired asset (>2 years old)
   - ScreenConnect/PDQ buttons open correct URLs in new tab
   - Notion URL link works from ticket detail
   - Mobile: Asset widget hidden, "View Assets" button reveals it
   - Navbar "Manage" dropdown works (desktop + mobile)
   - Empty states: No assets for contact, no Notion URL, no external tool IDs
3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Contact deletion sets assets to unassigned (not cascade delete)
   - Asset widget doesn't break ticket page if API fails
   - Cache invalidation works on asset create/update/delete
   - Lenovo API errors handled gracefully (manual test with invalid serial)
4. **Documentation:**
   - README updated with "Asset Management" section
   - Environment variables documented: `LENOVO_API_KEY`, `ASSET_CACHE_TTL` (optional)
   - API endpoints documented (if OpenAPI/Swagger exists)
   - Migration notes: Two migrations (assets table + clients.notion_url)
5. **Code Quality:**
   - ESLint/Prettier checks passing
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - No console errors on asset pages
   - Lighthouse score maintained (>90 performance)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Performance Validation - Asset Widget Load Time** (AC: 1, NFR1)
  - [ ] Open browser DevTools Network tab (Chrome or Safari)
  - [ ] Navigate to ticket detail page with contact that has assets
  - [ ] Measure time from page load to asset widget fully rendered (no skeleton UI)
  - [ ] Record load time for 5 different tickets with assets

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Traceability

**Epic 15 - Asset Management Integration:**
- **Parent Epic:** [docs/stories/epic-15-asset-management.md](epic-15-asset-management.md)
- **PRD Document:** [docs/prd-asset-management.md](../prd-asset-management.md)
- **PRD Section** (lines 894-943): "Story 15.11: Testing, Performance Validation, and Documentation"
- **Architecture:** [docs/architecture/asset-management-architecture.md](../architecture/asset-management-architecture.md)
- **Purpose:** Final validation that all Epic 15 requirements met, comprehensive testing, documentation for maintainability
- **Business Value:** Ensures asset management feature meets performance targets, is reliable, and maintainable by future developers

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 15.10 (Asset Age Calculation and Retirement Workflow):**
- Asset lifecycle management (active/retired/permanent delete) fully implemented
- Asset retirement excludes assets from widget and active lists (verified via status filter)
- Manual QA testing pattern established (detailed checklists, step-by-step validation)
- This story extends testing to cover ALL Epic 15 features, not just Story 15.10

**From Story 15.7 (Asset Widget on Ticket Detail Page):**
- Asset widget performance target: <500ms load time (critical NFR1)
- Widget uses async loading (React.lazy or useEffect) to prevent blocking ticket page render
- This story validates widget load time meets target, ticket page performance unchanged

**From Story 15.6 (Asset Caching Layer):**
- In-memory asset cache implemented with cache hit/miss logging
- Cache invalidation triggers on asset create/update/delete
- This story validates cache hit rate ≥95% over 24-hour test period (NFR9)

**From Story 15.5 (Lenovo Warranty API Integration):**
- Lenovo API integration with 10-second timeout and graceful error handling
- Manual warranty entry fallback always available (graceful degradation)
- This story validates error handling for invalid serials, timeouts, missing API key

**From Story 15.1 through 15.4 (Foundation Stories):**
- Asset database schema, CRUD API endpoints, List/Detail pages all implemented
- Contact deletion sets assets to unassigned (ON DELETE SET NULL) - critical integration behavior
- This story validates database integration, API correctness, UI functionality

### Testing Requirements

**From [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-strategy.md):**

- **Manual Testing Primary:** Frontend and integration testing via detailed manual QA checklists
- **No Automated E2E Tests:** Manual testing preferred for MVP (faster implementation, acceptable for single-user app). Dev agent should NOT create automated E2E tests for this story.
- **Cross-browser:** Chrome, Safari on macOS (existing requirement)
- **Performance Measurement:** Browser DevTools (Network tab, Lighthouse) + backend logs for cache metrics
- **Regression Focus:** Verify existing ticket/client/contact workflows unchanged, asset features don't break core system

**Story 15.11 Specific Testing:**
- **Performance Validation:** Measure widget load time, ticket page load time, asset list load time, cache hit rate
- **Manual QA:** Comprehensive checklist covering all asset workflows (create, edit, retire, reactivate, delete, Lenovo API, external links, mobile)
- **Integration Testing:** Contact deletion behavior, widget error handling, cache invalidation, Lenovo API errors
- **Documentation:** README update, environment variables, migrations, API endpoints (if OpenAPI exists)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint/Prettier, TypeScript strict mode, no console errors, Lighthouse performance score ≥90
- **Requirements Validation:** All 18 FRs, 10 NFRs, 4 CRs validated and documented

### Performance Validation Details

**Performance Targets from PRD:**

**NFR1: Asset Widget Load Time <500ms**
- **Measurement Method:** Browser DevTools Network tab, measure time from page load to widget fully rendered
- **Test Cases:** 5 different tickets with assets, record load times, calculate average
- **Acceptance:** All measurements <500ms, average significantly below 500ms (e.g., 200-300ms typical)
- **If Failed:** Profile with React DevTools, identify slow components (WarrantyBadge, ExternalToolLinks), optimize rendering

**NFR4: Ticket Page Load Time <10 Seconds (Unchanged)**
- **Measurement Method:** Compare baseline (before Epic 15) vs. current (with asset widget)
- **Baseline Establishment:** If pre-Epic 15 metrics unknown, use Stories 15.1-15.6 (pre-widget) as baseline OR test production environment before implementing Story 15.7
- **Test Cases:** 3 tickets: (1) no contact, (2) contact with 0 assets, (3) contact with 5+ assets
- **Acceptance:** No degradation from baseline, all measurements <10 seconds
- **If Failed:** Investigate blocking renders, ensure widget async load, optimize cache lookup

**Asset List Page Load Time <2 Seconds (300 Assets)**
- **Measurement Method:** Seed 300 assets, navigate to /assets, measure time to table fully rendered
- **Test Cases:** Initial load, pagination (page 2), filtered views (status=retired)
- **Acceptance:** Initial load <2s, pagination <1s (cached)
- **If Failed:** Review query performance, add missing indexes, optimize React rendering (virtualization if needed)

**NFR9: Cache Hit Rate ≥95%**
- **Measurement Method:** Backend logs cache hits/misses, 24-hour test period with normal usage
- **Test Environment:** Can be performed in staging/dev environment with simulated usage patterns
- **Timeline Note:** This 24-hour test can run in parallel with story completion. Start test, complete other tasks, check results before final story sign-off. Alternatively, this can be validated post-deployment as monitoring metric.
- **Calculation:** (hits / (hits + misses)) * 100
- **Acceptance:** ≥95% hit rate
- **If Failed:** Investigate cache invalidation bugs (too aggressive invalidation), fix logic, re-test

[Source: PRD lines 907-926 (Manual QA Checklist), Architecture lines 1094-1101 (Manual Testing Requirements)]

### Integration Testing Details

**Critical Integration Points:**

**Contact Deletion Behavior (FR2, FR2a):**
- **Expected:** Assets become unassigned (contact_id = NULL), remain linked to client (client_id NOT NULL)
- **Test:** Delete contact with 3 assets, query database, verify contact_id = NULL for all 3
- **Rationale:** Assets are client-owned, not contact-owned. Contact deletion should not cascade delete assets.

**Asset Widget Error Handling (FR13, CR1):**
- **Expected:** Widget failures don't crash ticket page, ticket page remains functional
- **Test:** Simulate API failure (stop backend), navigate to ticket detail, verify ticket page renders with error message
- **Rationale:** Widget is non-critical feature, core ticket functionality must remain available

**Cache Invalidation (FR7):**
- **Expected:** Asset create/update/delete triggers cache refresh, widget shows updated data
- **Test:** Edit asset hostname, refresh ticket page, verify widget displays new hostname
- **Rationale:** Stale cache = incorrect data in widget, user trust lost

**Lenovo API Error Handling (FR8, NFR7):**
- **Expected:** API errors (404, timeout, rate limit) display user-friendly messages, form remains usable
- **Test:** Invalid serial (404), disconnect internet (timeout), missing API key (graceful degradation)
- **Rationale:** External API failures should not break asset creation workflow, manual entry always available

[Source: PRD lines 919-926 (Integration Testing), Architecture lines 1086-1091 (Regression Testing)]

### Documentation Requirements

**README Update (AC: 4):**
- **Location:** `/README.md` (project root)
- **Content:**
  - Asset Management section (features overview)
  - Navigation: "Manage" → "Assets"
  - Asset widget location (ticket detail page)
  - Screenshot (optional): Asset list or widget
- **Rationale:** Help future developers understand asset features at a glance

**Environment Variables (AC: 4):**
- **Location:** `/README.md` or `/backend/.env.example`
- **Variables:**
  - `LENOVO_API_KEY` (string, optional) - Lenovo Support API key
  - `ASSET_CACHE_TTL` (number, optional, default: indefinite) - Cache time-to-live in seconds
- **Rationale:** Clear setup instructions for new deployments, graceful degradation if API key missing

**Database Migrations (AC: 4):**
- **Migration Files:**
  - `XXX_create_assets_table.sql` (creates assets table + indexes)
  - `XXX_add_clients_notion_url.sql` (adds clients.notion_url column)
- **Rollback Commands:**
  - `DROP TABLE assets CASCADE;`
  - `ALTER TABLE clients DROP COLUMN notion_url;`
- **Rationale:** Clear migration notes for production deployments, rollback instructions for emergencies

**API Endpoints (AC: 4, Optional):**
- **If OpenAPI/Swagger exists:** Add asset endpoints to spec
- **Endpoints:** POST /api/assets, GET /api/assets, GET /api/assets/:id, PUT /api/assets/:id, DELETE /api/assets/:id, DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent, POST /api/assets/:id/warranty-lookup, GET /api/assets/widget/:ticketId, PUT /api/clients/:id (notion_url field)
- **If no API docs:** Document in README instead (table format: Method, Endpoint, Description)
- **Rationale:** API discoverability for future feature development, integration with other tools

[Source: PRD lines 927-933 (Documentation), Architecture lines 619-829 (API Design)]

### Code Quality Standards

**ESLint/Prettier (AC: 5):**
- **Command:** `npm run lint` (from root or workspace directories)
- **Scope:** All asset-related files (backend routes, services, frontend components, API client)
- **Acceptance:** Zero linting errors, warnings acceptable if minor (e.g., unused var in dev code)
- **Rationale:** Consistent code style, catch common bugs (unused vars, missing dependencies)

**TypeScript Strict Mode (AC: 5):**
- **Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit` (from frontend directory)
- **Scope:** All frontend asset files (components, pages, API client, hooks)
- **Acceptance:** Zero TypeScript errors, all types properly defined in `/packages/shared/src/types/asset.ts`
- **Rationale:** Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves maintainability

**Console Errors (AC: 5):**
- **Tool:** Browser DevTools Console
- **Scope:** All asset pages (/assets, /assets/:id, ticket detail with widget)
- **Acceptance:** Zero critical errors (404s, uncaught exceptions, React warnings), minor warnings OK
- **Rationale:** Clean console = polished user experience, easier debugging

**Lighthouse Performance Score (AC: 5):**
- **Tool:** Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab
- **Scope:** Asset list page, ticket detail page (with widget)
- **Target:** Performance score ≥90 (Desktop mode)
- **Rationale:** Validate performance targets met (NFR1, NFR4), prevent performance regressions

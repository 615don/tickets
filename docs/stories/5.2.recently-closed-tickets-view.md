# Story 5.2: Recently Closed Tickets View

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see tickets I've closed in the last 7 days,
**so that** I can quickly re-open them if needed (FR4, FR11).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard includes "Recently Closed Tickets" section showing tickets closed within last 7 days
2. Section displays ticket ID, client name, description, closed date, total hours
3. Each ticket row shows "Re-open" button (Story 3.6 re-open logic)
4. Re-open button triggers re-open action with confirmation
5. Section shows empty state message if no recently closed tickets
6. Section limited to 10 most recent closed tickets with "View All" link if more exist
7. Clicking ticket row navigates to ticket detail page
8. Closed tickets older than 7 days do not show re-open button
9. Section updates in real-time when tickets closed or re-opened

## Tasks / Subtasks

> **NOTE FROM SCRUM MASTER:** According to the user, most functionality for this story has already been implemented during earlier development work. However, there are some gaps that need to be addressed, specifically around the re-open button display logic and confirmation dialog.

  - [x] Confirm `GET /api/tickets/recently-closed` exists
  - [x] Verify endpoint filters tickets by `closed_at >= 7 days ago`
  - [x] Verify response includes `canReopen` flag based on 7-day window
  - [x] Test authentication requirement

- [x] Task 2: Verify frontend hook and API service (AC: 1, 9)
  - [x] Confirm `useRecentlyClosedTickets()` hook exists in `frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts`
  - [x] Verify `ticketsApi.getRecentlyClosed()` service method exists
  - [x] Check React Query configuration for cache invalidation on ticket updates

- [x] Task 3: Verify Dashboard displays Recently Closed section (AC: 1, 2, 5, 7)
  - [x] Confirm "Recently Closed Tickets" section exists in Dashboard component
  - [x] Verify section displays: ticket ID, client name, description, total hours, closed date
  - [x] Check empty state message displays when no recently closed tickets
  - [x] Verify clicking ticket row navigates to ticket detail page

- [ ] Task 4: Implement re-open button with conditional display (AC: 3, 8) **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
  - [ ] Update TicketRow component to accept `canReopen` prop
  - [ ] Display "Re-open" button only when `ticket.canReopen === true`
  - [ ] Hide re-open button when `ticket.canReopen === false` (closed >7 days ago)
  - [ ] Update Dashboard to pass `canReopen` flag to TicketRow component
  - [ ] Test button visibility with tickets at different ages (6 days, 7 days, 8 days old)

- [ ] Task 5: Implement re-open confirmation dialog (AC: 4) **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
  - [ ] Create confirmation dialog component or use shadcn/ui AlertDialog
  - [ ] Dialog message: "Re-open ticket #[ID] for [Client Name]?"
  - [ ] Display ticket description in dialog for context
  - [ ] Add "Cancel" and "Re-open" action buttons
  - [ ] Wire up dialog to re-open mutation on confirmation
  - [ ] Show loading state during re-open API call

- [ ] Task 6: Implement re-open functionality (AC: 4, 9)
  - [ ] Connect "Re-open" button to `useUpdateTicket()` mutation
  - [ ] Call API: `PUT /api/tickets/:id { state: 'open' }`
  - [ ] Handle success: Show success toast, invalidate queries, close dialog
  - [ ] Handle error: Display error message (e.g., "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago")
  - [ ] Verify Dashboard updates automatically after re-opening ticket

- [x] Task 7: Implement "View All" functionality (AC: 6) **OPTIONAL - DEFER IF TIME CONSTRAINED**

  - [x] Link navigates to `/tickets?state=closed` (reuse existing tickets list page with filter)
  - [x] **Note:** Full dedicated closed tickets page with advanced filtering can be deferred to future story if needed. Minimum implementation is just displaying the link that routes to existing tickets page with closed filter.

- [x] Task 8: Verify real-time updates (AC: 9)
  - [x] Verify React Query invalidates `recentlyClosed` query on ticket state changes
  - [x] Test: Close a ticket → Recently Closed section updates

  - [ ] Manual testing on desktop and mobile viewports

## Dev Notes

### Important Context
**This story builds on existing Dashboard functionality implemented in [Story 5.1](docs/stories/5.1.dashboard-layout-navigation.md).** The backend API endpoints and frontend data fetching are already in place. The primary work needed is:

1. **Add re-open button with conditional display based on `canReopen` flag**
2. **Implement re-open confirmation dialog**
3. **Wire up re-open action to API mutation**
4. **(Optional) Implement "View All" link for >10 tickets**

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.1 implementation, Story 3.6 close/re-open logic]
- Dashboard component already displays Recently Closed section with ticket data
- Backend endpoint `/api/tickets/recently-closed` returns tickets with `canReopen` flag
- 7-day re-open window logic implemented in `Ticket.canReopen()` method
- TicketRow component has `showCloseButton` and `onReopen` props but they're not used correctly
- React Query cache invalidation on ticket mutations already configured

**VERIFIED:** The `/api/tickets/recently-closed` endpoint was implemented in Story 5.1 and exists in the codebase:
- Backend: `backend/src/routes/tickets.js:32` and `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js:222`
- Frontend hook: `frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts:37` (`useRecentlyClosedTickets`)
- Frontend API service: `frontend/src/lib/api/tickets.ts:132` (`getRecentlyClosed`)

**Gap Identified:** The TicketRow component accepts `showCloseButton` and `onReopen` props, but the Dashboard doesn't pass the `canReopen` flag properly. The re-open button should only display when `ticket.canReopen === true`.

### Relevant Source Tree
**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard with Recently Closed section
- `frontend/src/components/TicketRow.tsx` - Ticket row component (needs update for `canReopen` logic)
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Dashboard page that orchestrates data fetching
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts` - React Query hooks (`useRecentlyClosedTickets`, `useUpdateTicket`)
- `frontend/src/lib/api/tickets.ts` - API service with `getRecentlyClosed()` method
- `frontend/src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` - shadcn/ui AlertDialog for confirmation

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/routes/tickets.js` - Route: `GET /api/tickets/recently-closed`
- `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js` - Controller: `getRecentlyClosedTickets()`
- `backend/src/models/Ticket.js` - Model with `canReopen()` static method, `reopen()` method

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md, backend/src/models/Ticket.js]

**Ticket Interface (with canReopen flag):**
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: number;
  clientId: number;
  clientName: string;
  contactId: number;
  contactName: string;
  description: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
  state: 'open' | 'closed';
  closedAt: string | null;          // ISO timestamp when ticket closed
  canReopen: boolean | null;         // true: can reopen, false: >7 days, null: open ticket
  totalHours: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

**canReopen Flag Logic:**
- **`true`**: Ticket is closed AND `(now - closedAt) <= 7 days`
- **`false`**: Ticket is closed AND `(now - closedAt) > 7 days`
- **`null`**: Ticket is open (re-open not applicable)

This flag is automatically calculated in the backend `Ticket.convertToCamelCase()` method.

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md, backend implementation]

**Recently Closed Tickets Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets/recently-closed`
- **Auth:** Required (session-based)
- **Query Params:** None
- **Response:** Array of Ticket objects
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "clientId": 5,
      "clientName": "Acme Corp",
      "contactId": 12,
      "contactName": "John Doe",
      "description": "Fixed login bug",
      "notes": "User reported issue",
      "state": "closed",
      "closedAt": "2025-10-04T14:30:00.000Z",
      "canReopen": true,
      "totalHours": 2.5,
      "createdAt": "2025-10-04T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-04T14:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
  ```

**Re-open Ticket Endpoint:**
- **PUT** `/api/tickets/:id`
- **Auth:** Required
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  { "state": "open" }
  ```
- **Success Response (200):**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 42,
    "state": "open",
    "closedAt": null,
    "canReopen": null,
    ...
  }
  ```
- **Error Response (400) - Outside 7-day window:**
  ```json
  {
    "error": "ValidationError",
    "message": "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications
[Source: Existing implementation]

**Dashboard Component:**
The Dashboard already displays the Recently Closed section. Current implementation (lines 160-225 in Dashboard.tsx):
- Displays Recently Closed tickets in right sidebar (desktop) or below stats (mobile)
- Shows ticket count badge
- Empty state when no recently closed tickets
- Uses TicketRow component with `variant="desktop-closed"` or `variant="mobile"`

**Required Changes:**
1. Update Dashboard to pass `showCloseButton` and `onReopen` props to TicketRow for recently closed tickets
2. Only pass `showCloseButton={true}` when `ticket.canReopen === true`
3. Wire `onReopenTicket` handler to confirmation dialog

**TicketRow Component:**
Current implementation supports re-open button via props:
- `showCloseButton?: boolean` - Controls button visibility
- `onReopen?: (id: number) => void` - Callback when button clicked
- Button includes `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent row click

**Required Changes:**
1. Update logic to accept `canReopen` prop from ticket object
2. Display re-open button only when `canReopen === true`
3. Ensure desktop and mobile variants both support re-open button

**AlertDialog Component:**
Use shadcn/ui AlertDialog for confirmation:
```tsx
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogTrigger>Re-open</AlertDialogTrigger>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogHeader>
      <AlertDialogTitle>Re-open Ticket #{ticket.id}?</AlertDialogTitle>
      <AlertDialogDescription>
        Re-opening ticket for {ticket.clientName}: {ticket.description}
      </AlertDialogDescription>
    </AlertDialogHeader>
    <AlertDialogFooter>
      <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
      <AlertDialogAction onClick={handleReopen}>Re-open</AlertDialogAction>
    </AlertDialogFooter>
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

### Business Logic: 7-Day Re-open Window
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#ticket-close-reopen-logic]

**Calculation:**
```javascript
const daysSinceClosed = (now - closedAt) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
return daysSinceClosed <= 7;
```

**Rules:**
- Exactly 7 days (168 hours) is still eligible for re-opening
- After 7 days, re-open attempt returns 400 error
- Re-opening already-open ticket is idempotent (no error, no change)

**Backend Implementation:**
- `Ticket.canReopen(closedAt)` static method calculates eligibility
- `Ticket.reopen(id)` method sets `state='open'` and `closedAt=NULL`
- Controller validates 7-day window before allowing re-open
- Frontend should disable/hide button based on `canReopen` flag to prevent unnecessary API calls

### React Query Cache Invalidation
[Source: frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts]

**Query Keys:**
- Recently Closed: `['tickets', 'recently-closed']`
- Open Tickets: `['tickets', 'list', 'state=open']`
- Dashboard Stats: `['tickets', 'stats']`

**On Ticket Update:**
```typescript
onSuccess: (_, { id }) => {
  // Invalidate both list and detail queries
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ticketKeys.lists() });
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ticketKeys.detail(id) });
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ticketKeys.recentlyClosed() });
}
```

This ensures Dashboard updates automatically when a ticket is re-opened.

### Implementation Guidance

**Step 1: Update TicketRow to use canReopen flag**
Modify TicketRow component to check `ticket.canReopen` instead of relying solely on `showCloseButton` prop:
```typescript
const shouldShowReopenButton = ticket.canReopen === true && onReopen;
```

**Step 2: Create Reopen Confirmation Dialog**
Option A: Inline AlertDialog in TicketRow component
Option B: Separate ReopenDialog component for reusability

Recommended: Option B for cleaner separation of concerns.

**Step 3: Wire up re-open action**
In Dashboard's `onReopenTicket` handler:
1. Open confirmation dialog
2. On confirm: Call `updateTicket.mutateAsync({ id, data: { state: 'open' } })`
3. On success: Show toast notification
4. On error: Display error message in dialog or toast

**Step 4: Handle "View All" link (Optional)**
If ticket count > 10, show "View All ([count])" link that navigates to `/tickets?state=closed`. This reuses the existing tickets list page with a state filter. Full dedicated closed tickets page can be deferred to a future story.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Components:** Use shadcn/ui (AlertDialog, Button, Toast)
- **State Management:** React Query for mutations and cache invalidation
- **Confirmation UX:** Show confirmation dialog before destructive/state-changing actions
- **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages (not raw API errors)

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Manual browser testing for MVP
- Test on desktop and mobile viewports
- Backend tests using Node.js native test runner

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **Recently Closed Display:**
   - Create ticket, add time, close it → Should appear in Recently Closed section
   - Verify displays: ticket ID, client name, description, closed date, total hours
   - Verify empty state when no recently closed tickets

2. **Re-open Button Visibility:**
   - Ticket closed <7 days ago → Re-open button visible
   - Ticket closed exactly 7 days ago → Re-open button visible
   - Ticket closed >7 days ago → Re-open button hidden
   - Test by manually adjusting `closed_at` in database

3. **Re-open Confirmation:**
   - Click re-open button → Confirmation dialog appears
   - Click cancel → Dialog closes, ticket remains closed
   - Click re-open → API called, ticket re-opened, appears in Open Tickets section

4. **Re-open Success:**
   - Successfully re-opened ticket moves to Open Tickets section
   - Recently Closed section updates (ticket removed or count decreases)
   - Success toast notification displayed

5. **Re-open Error Handling:**
   - Attempt to re-open ticket >7 days old → Error message displayed
   - Network error during re-open → Error toast shown

6. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Close ticket in one browser tab → Recently Closed updates in another tab (on refocus)
   - Re-open ticket → Both sections update automatically

7. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Re-open button displays correctly in mobile card layout
   - Confirmation dialog displays properly on mobile viewports
   - Touch interactions work correctly

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Manual testing workflow
1. npm --prefix frontend run dev
2. npm --prefix backend start
3. Login to application
4. Create and close a ticket
5. Verify Recently Closed section displays ticket
6. Click re-open button → Verify confirmation dialog
7. Confirm re-open → Verify ticket moves to Open Tickets
8. Test edge cases (7-day boundary, >7 days)
```

**Backend Tests:**
Existing tests in `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js` should cover:
- `GET /api/tickets/recently-closed` returns correct tickets
- `PUT /api/tickets/:id` with `state: 'open'` re-opens ticket
- Re-open validation (7-day window enforcement)

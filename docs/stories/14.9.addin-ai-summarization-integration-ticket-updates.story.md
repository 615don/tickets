# Story 14.9: Add-in AI Summarization Integration (Ticket Updates)

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user adding time to an existing ticket,
**I want** the notes field to auto-populate with an AI-generated summary of the new email,
**so that** I can quickly document additional work without manual note-writing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When update mode is active (Epic 6 - existing ticket selected), AI summarization triggers on contact match
2. AI processes only the current email (not full thread, since ticket already has context)
3. Notes field auto-populates with AI-generated summary
4. Description field is NOT modified (ticket description already exists)
5. Time entry submission includes AI-generated notes
6. All error handling from Story 7.8 applies (graceful degradation on AI failure)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 0: Verify Story Dependencies** (Prerequisites)
  - [x] Verify Story 7.8 complete: Check that AI integration for new tickets is working
  - [x] Verify AI API client exists: `outlook-addin/src/lib/api/ai.ts` with `summarizeEmail` function
  - [x] Verify email thread builder exists: `outlook-addin/src/lib/utils/emailThreadBuilder.ts`
  - [x] Verify Epic 6 ticket update workflow: Confirm existing open ticket selection and time entry flow
  - [x] If any dependencies missing, HALT and report which story needs completion

- [x] **Task 1: Review Existing Ticket Update Workflow** (Epic 6 Integration Analysis)
  - [x] Read Epic 6 documentation to understand ticket update mode
  - [x] Identify where update mode is activated (likely in TicketForm or App component)
  - [x] Identify state management for selected ticket (ticketId, existing description)
  - [x] Understand how time entry differs from new ticket creation (likely different endpoint)
  - [x] Document key differences between new ticket mode and update mode for AI integration
  - [x] **Expected Findings:**
    - Update mode likely uses different form state or component variant
    - Time entry API endpoint likely `POST /api/tickets/:id/time-entries` or similar
    - Description field should be read-only or hidden in update mode
    - Notes field should be editable and submitted as time entry notes
  - [x] [Source: Epic 6 PRD and existing TicketForm implementation]

- [x] **Task 2: Verify useMatching Hook Works for Update Mode** (AC: 1, 2) - **VERIFICATION ONLY, NO CODE CHANGES**
  - [x] Open file: `outlook-addin/src/hooks/useMatching.ts`
  - [x] Review existing AI trigger logic from Story 7.8
  - [x] **CONFIRM: The hook does NOT need to know about update mode**
    - Hook always processes AI summarization after contact match (same logic for both modes)
    - Hook always returns both `description` and `notes` in aiSummary
    - TicketForm component decides which fields to populate based on its own `formMode` state
  - [x] **VERIFY: Hook behavior is identical for both modes (NO modifications needed)**
    - Existing logic: AI triggers after contact match, builds email thread, calls API, returns summary
    - Hook doesn't need to know about form mode - that's TicketForm's responsibility
    - Both `description` and `notes` are always returned from AI API
    - TicketForm's useEffect (Task 3) handles conditional population based on `formMode`
  - [x] **AC2 Clarification**: "Process only current email" is handled by existing `buildEmailThread` utility
    - Story 7.8 already implemented single-email processing (not full conversation thread)
    - No changes needed for Story 7.9 - same behavior applies to both modes
  - [x] [Source: Story 7.8 implementation + Epic 7 PRD Story 7.9 AC1-2]

- [x] **Task 3: Update TicketForm Component for Update Mode** (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Open file: `outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx`
  - [x] Review existing AI summary handling from Story 7.8 (lines 81-88):
    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      if (aiSummary && !selectedTicket) {
        // Only auto-populate when not in add-time-entry mode
        setDescription(aiSummary.description);
        setNotes(aiSummary.notes);
      }
    }, [aiSummary, selectedTicket]);
    ```
  - [x] **KEY INSIGHT**: Story 7.8 already has `&& !selectedTicket` guard! This prevents description population in update mode.
  - [x] **Modify to also populate notes in update mode** (AC3):
    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      if (aiSummary) {
        // Derive form mode from selectedTicket (Epic 6 pattern - line 63)
        const isUpdateMode = !!selectedTicket;

        if (isUpdateMode) {
          // AC3: In update mode, only populate notes (not description)
          // AC4: Description field NOT modified (already disabled and pre-filled with ticket description)
          setNotes(aiSummary.notes);
        } else {
          // New ticket mode: populate both fields (Story 7.8 behavior)
          setDescription(aiSummary.description);
          setNotes(aiSummary.notes);
        }
      }
    }, [aiSummary, selectedTicket]);
    ```
  - [x] **Note on formMode**: Component already has `const formMode: FormMode = selectedTicket ? 'add-time-entry' : 'create-ticket';` (line 63)
    - Can use `formMode` directly instead of `!!selectedTicket` if preferred
    - Both approaches are equivalent: `formMode === 'add-time-entry'` or `!!selectedTicket`
  - [x] Verify description field behavior in update mode:
    - [x] Description field should be read-only, hidden, or disabled when `isUpdateMode === true`
    - [x] If not already implemented, ensure description is not editable in update mode
  - [x] Verify time entry submission:
    - [x] AC5: Time entry submission should include AI-generated notes like any other notes
    - [x] Ensure existing submission logic passes notes to time entry endpoint
    - [x] No special handling required for AI-generated content (same as manual entry)
  - [x] [Source: Epic 7 PRD Story 7.9 AC3-5]

- [x] **Task 4: Test Error Handling in Update Mode** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Verify graceful degradation works identically in update mode:
    - [x] If AI fails, notes field remains empty (user enters manually)
    - [x] Error is logged to console for debugging
    - [x] Form remains usable (time entry can still be submitted)
  - [x] Verify loading states show during AI processing in update mode
  - [x] Verify update workflow continues if AI is not configured (no API key)
  - [x] **No code changes expected** - error handling from Story 7.8 should apply automatically
  - [x] [Source: Epic 7 PRD Story 7.9 AC6, NFR3]

- [x] **Task 5: Unit Tests for Update Mode Logic** (Testing) - **DECISION: NO NEW UNIT TESTS REQUIRED**
  - [x] Review existing AI integration tests from Story 7.8:
    - [x] `outlook-addin/src/lib/api/__tests__/ai.test.ts` - AI API client tests (passing)
    - [x] `outlook-addin/src/lib/utils/__tests__/emailThreadBuilder.test.ts` - Email thread builder tests (passing)
  - [x] **DECISION RATIONALE: No new unit tests needed because:**
    - ✅ useMatching hook is unchanged (Task 2 verification confirms no modifications)
    - ✅ AI API client unchanged - same `summarizeEmail` function for both modes
    - ✅ emailThreadBuilder unchanged - same single-email processing for both modes
    - ✅ Only change is TicketForm useEffect logic (conditional field population)
    - ✅ TicketForm logic is simple conditional (not complex enough to warrant unit testing per project standards)
    - ✅ Story 6.3 already validated time entry submission logic (backend tests passing)
  - [x] **Testing Coverage:** Manual E2E testing in Task 6 provides sufficient validation for this simple integration
  - [x] **If implementation reveals unexpected complexity:** Developer may add tests at discretion, but not required for story approval
  - [x] [Source: Testing strategy - unit tests for complex logic only, manual tests for simple UI integration]

- [ ] **Task 6: Manual End-to-End Testing in Update Mode** (AC: All)
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Update existing ticket with AI success**
    - [ ] Create a new ticket (Story 7.8 flow)
    - [ ] Keep ticket open (not marked as done)
    - [ ] Select a new email from the same contact
    - [ ] Verify contact match triggers
    - [ ] Verify update mode activates (existing ticket detected)
    - [ ] Verify only notes field auto-populates with AI summary
    - [ ] Verify description field is NOT modified (shows original ticket description)
    - [ ] Submit time entry and verify notes appear in database
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Update existing ticket with AI failure**
    - [ ] Temporarily disable AI (remove API key or simulate network error)
    - [ ] Select email for existing open ticket
    - [ ] Verify contact match succeeds but notes field remains empty
    - [ ] Verify form is still usable (enter notes manually)
    - [ ] Submit time entry successfully with manual notes
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Switch between new ticket and update modes**
    - [ ] Select email with open ticket → verify update mode + notes only
    - [ ] Select different email with no open ticket → verify new ticket mode + description + notes
    - [ ] Verify AI runs correctly in both cases
    - [ ] Verify no state leakage between modes (AI summary clears when switching)
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 4: Multiple time entries with AI**
    - [ ] Add first time entry to ticket (AI-generated notes)
    - [ ] Add second time entry to same ticket (different AI-generated notes)
    - [ ] Verify both time entries have correct notes in database
    - [ ] Verify notes don't accumulate or overwrite previous entries

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 7.8 (AI Integration for New Tickets):**
- AI API client implemented in `outlook-addin/src/lib/api/ai.ts` with `summarizeEmail(emailThread)` function
- Email thread builder implemented in `outlook-addin/src/lib/utils/emailThreadBuilder.ts`
- `useMatching` hook extended with AI summarization trigger (fires after contact match)
- Hook returns `{ matchingResult, isMatching, error, aiSummary, isGeneratingAi, aiError }`
- TicketForm component uses `useEffect` to auto-populate description/notes from `aiSummary`
- Error handling is graceful: AI failures don't block form usage
- Loading states integrated with existing matching spinner
- All unit tests passing for AI client and emailThreadBuilder
- [Source: Story 7.8 completion notes]

**From Epic 6 (Ticket Updates / Time Entries):**
- Update mode allows adding time entries to existing open tickets
- Time entry workflow reuses TicketForm component with different mode/state
- Time entries include notes field but NOT description (description is ticket-level)
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticketId/time-entries` (confirmed in Story 6.3)
- Contact matching works identically for updates (same trigger point for AI)
- [Source: Epic 7 PRD integration requirements - Story 7.9 builds on Epic 6]

### Epic 6 Integration Context

**Update Mode Detection (How TicketForm Knows It's in Update Mode):**
- TicketForm maintains `selectedTicket` state variable (from Story 6.2)
- Form mode is derived automatically: `const formMode: FormMode = selectedTicket ? 'add-time-entry' : 'create-ticket';`
- When user clicks an open ticket from OpenTicketsList, `selectedTicket` is set
- When `selectedTicket` is null, form is in default "create ticket" mode
- [Source: [TicketForm.tsx:51-63](../../../outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx#L51-L63)]

**Time Entry API Endpoint (Confirmed):**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tickets/:ticketId/time-entries`
- Accepts payload: `{ workDate?, duration, billable?, notes? }`
- Returns: `{ id, ticketId, workDate, durationHours, billable, createdAt }`
- Error responses: 400 (invalid/closed), 401 (auth), 404 (not found), 500 (server)
- [Source: Story 6.3 Dev Notes - Backend API Design]

**Description Field Behavior in Update Mode:**
- Description field is **disabled** (not editable) when `formMode === 'add-time-entry'`
- Pre-populated with `selectedTicket.description` via useEffect
- Implementation: `<DescriptionTextarea disabled={formMode === 'add-time-entry'} />`
- Description validation skipped in update mode (field is read-only)
- [Source: [TicketForm.tsx:70-79](../../../outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx#L70-L79), Story 6.3 AC2]

**Form State Management:**
- `selectedTicket` resets to null when matchingResult changes (user switches emails)
- After successful time entry submission, form returns to create mode (selectedTicket cleared)
- Clear Selection button allows manual return to create mode
- [Source: [TicketForm.tsx:65-68](../../../outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx#L65-L68)]

**AI Integration Point:**
- AI summarization triggers AFTER contact match succeeds (same as Story 7.8)
- In update mode, only the notes field should be auto-populated (description is disabled)
- Story 7.8 already has logic: `if (aiSummary && !selectedTicket)` to prevent description population in update mode
- This story extends that pattern to also populate notes in update mode
- [Source: [TicketForm.tsx:81-88](../../../outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx#L81-L88)]

### Component Integration Strategy

**Key Insight: Minimal Changes Required**

Story 7.9 is a **mode-aware extension** of Story 7.8, not a complete reimplementation:

1. **useMatching Hook:** No changes required
   - Hook logic remains identical for both new tickets and updates
   - Hook always returns `{ description, notes }` from AI
   - Form component decides which fields to use based on mode

2. **TicketForm Component:** Conditional field population
   - Modify existing `useEffect` for `aiSummary` to check mode
   - If `isUpdateMode`: populate only notes field
   - If new ticket mode: populate both description and notes (existing behavior)

3. **Error Handling:** No changes required
   - Graceful degradation from Story 7.8 applies automatically
   - Console logging, loading states, error states all work identically

**Why This Approach:**
- Reduces code duplication (reuse existing AI infrastructure)
- Maintains consistency (AI behavior identical in both modes)
- Simplifies testing (most tests already written in Story 7.8)
- Minimizes risk (small targeted change to form component)

### API Specifications

**POST /api/ai/summarize-email** (No changes from Story 7.8)

Story 7.9 reuses the same AI summarization endpoint. The backend doesn't need to know whether the summary is for a new ticket or time entry—both use cases send a single email and receive `{ description, notes }`.

**Request/Response:** Identical to Story 7.8
- Request: `{ emails: [{ from, subject, body }] }`
- Response: `{ description, notes, truncated, emailCount, success?, error? }`

**Note:** In update mode, the frontend ignores `description` from the response and only uses `notes`.

[Source: Story 7.8 Dev Notes - API Specifications section]

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `outlook-addin/src/hooks/useMatching.ts` - **NO CHANGES** (hook logic works for both modes)
- `outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx` - **MODIFY** conditional field population based on mode
- `outlook-addin/src/App.tsx` - **VERIFY** mode detection and state management (may need no changes)

**Files to Create:**
- **NONE** - Story 7.8 already created all necessary utilities

**Files to Test:**
- Manual E2E testing only (Task 6)
- No new unit tests required unless conditional logic is complex

[Source: Story 7.8 file locations + minimalist integration strategy]

### Technical Constraints

**Epic 7 Design Principles (Apply to Story 7.9):**
- **Minimal UI Footprint:** No new UI elements for AI in update mode
- **Graceful Degradation:** AI failures never block time entry submission
- **Reuse Story 7.8 Infrastructure:** Don't rebuild what's already working
- **Contact-Match Gating:** AI only runs when contact match succeeds (same as Story 7.8)
- **Single Email Processing:** In update mode, only current email is sent to AI (AC2)

**Key Difference from Story 7.8:**
- Story 7.8: Populate description + notes (new ticket)
- Story 7.9: Populate notes only (existing ticket)

**Implementation Insight:**
The backend always returns both `description` and `notes` from the AI API. The difference is **frontend consumption**, not backend behavior. This keeps the API simple and reusable.

[Source: Epic 7 PRD Requirements + Story 7.8 insights]

### Integration Verification

**IV1: Existing ticket update workflow (Epic 6) continues to function if AI is disabled or fails**
- If AI API key not configured, update mode works normally with manual notes entry
- If AI call fails, update mode allows manual notes entry (graceful degradation)
- Time entry submission logic unchanged (AI-generated notes treated identically to manual notes)

**IV2: Time entries with AI-generated notes are stored identically to manual entries**
- No special database flags or metadata for AI content
- Time entry notes field accepts any text (AI-generated or manual)
- Backend has no awareness of content source (maintains simplicity)

**IV3: Switching between emails in Outlook properly clears/repopulates notes field**
- When user selects different email, matching hook re-runs
- Previous `aiSummary` state is cleared
- New email triggers new AI summarization
- Notes field updates with new summary (doesn't accumulate)
- Verify no state leakage between email selections

## Testing

### Test Environment

**Required Environment for Manual Testing:**
- **Outlook Web Access** (primary test environment)
  - Browser: Chrome or Edge (latest versions)
  - Test in production Outlook Web OR test Microsoft 365 tenant
  - Add-in must be sideloaded via manifest
- **Backend server** running locally or on Railway (with AI API key configured)
- **Database** with test data:
  - At least one client with contacts
  - At least one open ticket for testing update mode
  - AI settings configured with valid OpenAI API key
- **Network access** to OpenAI API (for AI summarization tests)

**Pre-Test Setup:**
1. Start backend: `npm run start` from backend directory
2. Start add-in: `npm run dev` from outlook-addin directory
3. Sideload manifest in Outlook Web
4. Verify AI settings configured in admin UI
5. Have test emails ready (from known contacts)

[Source: Story 7.8 testing approach, Epic 6 testing patterns]

### Test File Location

**No new test files required for Story 7.9** - Story 7.8 created comprehensive unit tests for:
- AI API client (`outlook-addin/src/lib/api/__tests__/ai.test.ts`)
- Email thread builder (`outlook-addin/src/lib/utils/__tests__/emailThreadBuilder.test.ts`)

**Rationale:**
- useMatching hook logic unchanged (no new branches to test)
- Conditional field population in TicketForm is simple logic (covered by E2E manual testing)
- Backend endpoint unchanged (existing tests from Story 7.5 cover AI summarization)

### Testing Frameworks

**Backend:** Node.js native test runner (`node --test`)
**Frontend (Add-in):** Manual testing in Outlook Web (no Jest, Vitest, or automated E2E for MVP)

### Test Standards

**Manual E2E Testing (Task 6):**
- Test in real Outlook Web environment (see Test Environment above)
- Verify both new ticket mode and update mode
- Verify AI success and failure scenarios
- Verify mode switching (no state leakage)
- Verify database persistence of AI-generated time entry notes

**Story 7.9 Test Coverage:**
- **Unit tests:** NONE (reuses Story 7.8 infrastructure - Task 5 decision)
- **Manual E2E tests:** Task 6 scenarios (4 test cases)

Fixed missing disabled prop in DescriptionTextarea. All existing tests passing (9/9 AI client, 8/8 email thread builder). TypeScript compilation and build successful. Ready for manual E2E testing (Task 6). | James (Dev Agent) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 (Sonnet 4.5)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation was straightforward with no blocking issues.

### Completion Notes List

1. **Minimal Implementation Approach:** Story 7.9 required only a small modification to TicketForm component's AI summary handling useEffect. The existing infrastructure from Story 7.8 works perfectly for both modes.

2. **Hook Separation of Concerns:** useMatching hook remains completely unchanged. It's mode-agnostic by design - always returns both description and notes, letting the form component decide which to use based on context.

3. **Bug Fix During Implementation:** Discovered and fixed missing TypeScript interface for `disabled` prop in DescriptionTextarea component. This was an existing bug from Epic 6 that surfaced during type checking.

4. **Test Strategy Validation:** No new unit tests required per story specification. Existing Story 7.8 tests (AI client: 9/9 passing, email thread builder: 8/8 passing) provide coverage for unchanged infrastructure. Manual E2E testing (Task 6) validates integration.

5. **Build & Type Check:** TypeScript compilation and production build successful. Modified files pass linting with no new issues.

6. **Ready for Manual Testing:** All code tasks (0-5) complete. Task 6 requires manual E2E testing in live Outlook Web environment with sideloaded add-in. See Task 6 test scenarios for required validation steps.

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `outlook-addin/src/components/TicketForm.tsx` - Updated AI summary useEffect to support both new ticket and update modes (lines 81-97)
- `outlook-addin/src/components/DescriptionTextarea.tsx` - Added missing `disabled` prop to interface and implementation

**No New Files Created** - Reused all existing Story 7.8 infrastructure

**Test Files (Existing, All Passing):**
- `outlook-addin/src/lib/api/__tests__/ai.test.ts` - 9/9 tests passing
- `outlook-addin/src/lib/utils/__tests__/emailThreadBuilder.test.ts` - 8/8 tests passing

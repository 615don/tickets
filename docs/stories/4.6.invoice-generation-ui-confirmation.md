# Story 4.6: Invoice Generation UI & Confirmation

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to generate and push invoices to Xero with confirmation,
**so that** I can complete monthly billing confidently (FR13).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. "Generate Invoices" button in pre-invoice review screen (Story 4.5) triggers generation
2. Confirmation dialog shown before invoicing: "Generate invoices for [Month]? This will lock all time entries for this month."
3. User confirms, system calls invoice generation API (Story 4.4)
4. Loading indicator shown during Xero API calls (may take several seconds)
5. Success message displayed with summary: "Generated X invoices for Y clients. Total: $Z"
6. Success message includes links to Xero invoices (if Xero provides URLs)
7. Error handling displays clear messages: missing descriptions, Xero connection errors, API failures
8. After successful generation, review screen switches to locked/read-only mode
9. "View in Xero" links provided for easy access to generated invoices
10. Action logged (optional but recommended for audit trail)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 4.5 (Pre-Invoice Review UI):**
- Invoice preview page: `frontend/src/pages/InvoicePreview.tsx`
- GenerateInvoicesButton component: `frontend/src/components/GenerateInvoicesButton.tsx`
- Invoice preview hook: `frontend/src/hooks/useInvoicePreview.ts`
- Invoice API service: `frontend/src/lib/api/invoices.ts`
- Type definitions: `frontend/src/types/invoice.ts`
- Button already integrated into InvoicePreview page with validation logic
- Button disabled when `missingDescriptionCount > 0` or `isLocked === true`
- Integration point ready: `onGenerate` callback in GenerateInvoicesButton

**From Story 4.4 (Invoice Generation & Xero Push Logic):**
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/invoices/generate`
- Request body: `{ month: "YYYY-MM" }`
- Response format: `{ success: true, month: "...", clientsInvoiced: 5, totalBillableHours: 42.5, xeroInvoiceIds: [...], message: "..." }`
- **IMPORTANT:** `xeroInvoiceIds` contains invoice **IDs** (GUIDs), not invoice numbers
- **Story 4.4 Fix Required:** invoiceController.js:434 must be updated to store `xeroInvoice.invoiceID` instead of `xeroInvoice.invoiceNumber`
- Error response format: `{ error: "ErrorType", message: "Human-readable message" }`
- Error types: `ValidationError`, `InvoiceLockError`, `XeroConnectionError`, `XeroSetupError`, `XeroApiError`, `DatabaseError`
- Invoice controller: `backend/src/controllers/invoiceController.js`
- Generation endpoint validates descriptions, lock status, Xero connection before processing

**From Story 4.3 (Pre-Invoice Review Data Aggregation):**
- Invoice preview query invalidation refreshes lock status and data
- After invoice generation, `isLocked` changes from `false` to `true`
- Preview data includes `month`, `isLocked`, `totalBillableHours`, `clients[]`

**From Story 4.1 (Xero OAuth Connection):**
- React Query patterns: `useXero.ts` for mutations and queries
- Toast notifications via shadcn/ui Toast component
- Error handling patterns for API failures

### Data Models

**Invoice Generation Request** [Source: Story 4.4 API Specification]

```typescript
interface InvoiceGenerationRequest {
  month: string; // YYYY-MM format
}
```

**Invoice Generation Response** [Source: Story 4.4 API Specification]

```typescript
interface InvoiceGenerationResponse {
  success: boolean;
  month: string; // YYYY-MM format
  clientsInvoiced: number;
  totalBillableHours: number;
  xeroInvoiceIds: string[]; // Array of Xero invoice numbers/IDs
  message: string; // "Successfully generated X invoices for Y clients"
}
```

**Invoice Generation Error Response** [Source: Story 4.4 API Specification]

```typescript
interface InvoiceGenerationError {
  error: string; // Error type: ValidationError, InvoiceLockError, XeroConnectionError, etc.

**Request:**
```bash
POST /api/invoices/generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "month": "2025-10"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**

}
```

**Error Responses:**

### Component Architecture

**Component Hierarchy:**

```
InvoicePreview (page)
├── GenerateInvoicesButton (component)
│   ├── Button (shadcn/ui)
│   └── InvoiceGenerationDialog (new component)
│       ├── Dialog (shadcn/ui)
│       ├── Loading indicator during mutation
│       ├── Success message with Xero links
│       └── Error message display
```

**Component Responsibilities:**

**InvoiceGenerationDialog (New Component):**
- Display confirmation message with month and warning
- Trigger invoice generation mutation on user confirmation
- Show loading state during API call
- Display success message with summary and Xero invoice links
- Display error messages with actionable guidance
- Handle dialog open/close state
- Emit events to parent component (success, cancel)

**GenerateInvoicesButton (Modified Component):**
- Manage dialog open/close state
- Pass month and mutation to dialog
- Disable button during loading
- Update button text to "Generating..." when loading
- Remain disabled if `missingDescriptionCount > 0` or `isLocked === true`

**InvoicePreview (Modified Page):**
- Invalidate invoice preview query after successful generation
- Detect `isLocked: true` and switch to read-only mode
- Disable inline editing when locked
- Hide "Generate Invoices" button when locked
- Display lock status badge

### UI/UX Design Patterns

**Confirmation Dialog:**
- Modal dialog with backdrop (prevents interaction with page)
- Clear warning message with month name
- Emphasis on "lock" consequence: "This will lock all time entries for this month."
- Two-button layout: "Cancel" (secondary) and "Generate Invoices" (primary/destructive)
- Keyboard support: Esc to cancel, Enter to confirm
- Focus management: focus "Generate Invoices" button on open, restore focus on close

**Loading Indicator:**
- Full-screen spinner or modal overlay
- Loading message: "Generating invoices... This may take a few seconds."
- Disable all interactions during loading
- ARIA live region announces loading state to screen readers
- Use shadcn/ui Spinner or custom loading component

**Success Message:**
- Toast notification (auto-dismiss after 10 seconds) OR
- Dialog with manual dismiss (preferred for important actions)
- Summary format: "Successfully generated [X] invoices for [Y] clients. Total: [Z] billable hours."
- List of Xero invoice links grouped under "View Invoices in Xero"
- Each link styled as button or hyperlink with external link icon
- Success icon (checkmark) for visual feedback
- Green/success color scheme

**Error Messages:**
- Toast notification (auto-dismiss after 10 seconds) OR
- Alert dialog with manual dismiss
- Display error message from API response
- Include actionable guidance ("Please connect to Xero in Settings")
- Red/destructive color scheme
- Error icon (alert circle) for visual feedback
- "Retry" button for transient errors (network, rate limit)

**Locked State UI:**
- Lock status badge displayed prominently: "✓ Invoiced" or "🔒 Locked"
- "Generate Invoices" button hidden
- Inline editing disabled (no edit buttons visible)
- All ticket descriptions read-only
- Optional: Display locked date "Invoiced on [Date]"

### Xero Invoice URL Retrieval

[Source: Xero API Documentation, developer.xero.com]

**OnlineInvoice Endpoint:**
```
GET /api.xro/2.0/Invoices/{InvoiceID}/OnlineInvoice
```

**Important:** The backend must use **InvoiceID** (GUID format like `bd709179-ba9b-492b-bd5c-305a31f2e5ca`), not InvoiceNumber (human-readable like `INV-12345`).

**Backend Endpoint Specification:**
```
GET /api/xero/invoices/:invoiceId/online-url

Response:
{
  "onlineInvoiceUrl": "https://go.xero.com/..."
}
```

**Rate Limit:** 60 calls/minute - sufficient for typical invoice generation (5-20 invoices per month).

**Note:** Story 4.4 implementation currently stores invoice numbers. This must be updated to store invoice IDs (GUIDs) instead. See invoiceController.js:434.

### Tech Stack

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend Technologies:**
- **React:** v18.3.1 - UI component library
- **TypeScript:** v5.8.3 - Type-safe development
- **React Query (TanStack Query):** v5.83.0 - Server state management for mutations
- **shadcn/ui:** Latest (Radix UI v1.x) - Dialog, Alert, Button, Spinner components
- **Tailwind CSS:** v3.4.17 - Styling

**Key Components for This Story:**
- **Dialog/AlertDialog:** Confirmation dialog for invoice generation
- **Alert:** Success and error message display
- **Button:** "Generate Invoices" button with loading state
- **Spinner:** Loading indicator during API call
- **Toast:** Optional for success/error notifications

### Coding Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Components:** PascalCase → `InvoiceGenerationDialog.tsx`
- **Hooks:** camelCase with 'use' prefix → `useGenerateInvoices`
- **API Routes:** kebab-case → `/api/invoices/generate`
- **Type Sharing:** Define types in `frontend/src/types/invoice.ts`
- **API Calls:** Always use service layer (`lib/api/invoices.ts`), never direct fetch in components
- **Error Handling:** Extract error from API response format `{ error: string, message: string }`
- **State Updates:** Never mutate state directly (React Query handles immutability)

### React Query Mutation Pattern

**Mutation Hook:**

```typescript
// frontend/src/hooks/useInvoicePreview.ts
export function useGenerateInvoices() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (month: string) => {
      return await invoicesApi.generateInvoices(month);
    },
    onSuccess: (data, month) => {
      // Invalidate invoice preview to refresh lock status
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['invoicePreview', month]);

      // Optional: Show success toast
      toast({
        title: 'Invoices Generated',
        description: data.message,
        variant: 'default',
      });
    },
    onError: (error: any) => {
      // Error handled in component UI
      console.error('Invoice generation failed:', error);
    },
  });
}
```

**Component Usage:**

```typescript
// InvoiceGenerationDialog.tsx
const { mutate, isLoading, isError, error, data, isSuccess } = useGenerateInvoices();

const handleConfirm = () => {
  mutate(month);
};

// Render logic based on state
if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (isSuccess) return <SuccessMessage data={data} />;
if (isError) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**Error Types and User Messages:**

| Error Type | HTTP Code | User Message | Action Guidance |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| ValidationError | 400 | "Cannot generate invoices. Missing descriptions for tickets: #42, #57" | Edit descriptions in preview screen |
| InvoiceLockError | 400 | "Month already locked. Invoices have already been generated." | No action (informational) |
| XeroConnectionError | 400 | "Xero is not connected. Please connect to Xero in Settings." | Navigate to Settings > Xero |
| XeroSetupError | 400 | "Xero item 'Consulting Services' not found. Please create this item in Xero." | Open Xero in new tab, create item |
| XeroApiError (rate limit) | 429 | "Xero API rate limit exceeded. Please try again in 60 seconds." | Wait and retry |
| XeroApiError (general) | 500 | "Failed to create invoices in Xero. Please try again." | Retry button |
| DatabaseError | 500 | "Failed to lock month. Invoices may have been created in Xero. Please verify." | Contact support, check Xero UI |

**Error Display:**
- Use shadcn/ui Alert with destructive variant for errors
- Display error message from API response (`error.message`)
- Include actionable guidance in message
- Log full error to console for debugging
- Provide "Retry" button for transient errors (network, rate limit)
- For critical errors (DatabaseError), suggest manual verification

### Accessibility

[Source: WCAG 2.1 AA standards, shadcn/ui best practices]

**Dialog Accessibility:**
- ARIA attributes: `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- Focus trap: focus stays within dialog when open
- Focus management: focus "Generate Invoices" button on open, restore focus on close
- Keyboard support: Esc to close, Enter to confirm, Tab to navigate
- Screen reader announcements: Dialog title and description read on open

**Loading State:**
- ARIA live region: `aria-live="polite"` announces loading message
- Loading message: "Generating invoices... This may take a few seconds."
- Disable all interactive elements during loading

**Success/Error Messages:**
- ARIA live region: `aria-live="assertive"` for errors, `aria-live="polite"` for success
- Success message announced: "Successfully generated X invoices for Y clients"
- Error message announced with actionable guidance

**Xero Invoice Links:**
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1)
- Focus indicator on keyboard navigation
- ARIA label: "View invoice [ID] in Xero"
- External link icon (visual indicator)
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework:** Manual testing for MVP (Vitest planned for future)

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

**Functional Tests:**
- [ ] Click "Generate Invoices" button opens confirmation dialog
- [ ] Confirmation dialog displays correct month name and warning
- [ ] Cancel button closes dialog without triggering generation
- [ ] Confirm button triggers invoice generation API call
- [ ] Loading indicator displayed during API call
- [ ] Success message displayed with correct summary (X invoices, Y clients, Z hours)
- [ ] Xero invoice links displayed and clickable
- [ ] Xero links open in new tab to correct URL
- [ ] Review screen switches to locked mode after success (lock badge visible, edit disabled, button hidden)
- [ ] Invoice preview query invalidated and refetched after success

**Error Handling Tests:**
- [ ] Missing descriptions: Should not reach confirmation (button disabled)
- [ ] Month already locked: API returns 400, error message displayed
- [ ] Xero not connected: API returns 400, error message with Settings link
- [ ] Xero missing item: API returns 400, error message with setup instructions
- [ ] Rate limit (429): Error message with "retry in 60 seconds"
- [ ] Network error: Generic error message with retry button
- [ ] Database error: Critical error message with manual verification guidance

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Clicking "Generate Invoices" multiple times (should only trigger once due to loading state)
- [ ] Navigating away during loading (mutation aborted, no side effects)
- [ ] Dialog open when month changes (dialog should close or month should update)

**Accessibility Tests:**
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: Tab to button, Enter to open dialog, Esc to close
- [ ] Focus management: focus "Generate Invoices" button on dialog open, restore on close
- [ ] Screen reader: Dialog title and description announced on open
- [ ] Screen reader: Loading state announced ("Generating invoices...")
- [ ] Screen reader: Success message announced with summary
- [ ] Screen reader: Error message announced with actionable guidance
- [ ] Xero links: Focus indicator visible, ARIA label read by screen reader

**Browser Compatibility:**
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (viewport < 768px)

- **File**: [frontend/src/pages/InvoicePreview.tsx:78-102](frontend/src/pages/InvoicePreview.tsx#L78-102)
  - **Change**: Replaced `as any` type assertion with proper type guards in error parsing logic
  - **Why**: Type safety violation - `any` bypasses TypeScript's type checking
  - **How**: Implemented defensive type checking with `typeof` guards and explicit type narrowing for safer error handling

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS
  - Component naming (PascalCase), hook naming (camelCase with 'use'), API routes (kebab-case) all correct
  - API calls properly use service layer pattern
  - Standard error format maintained: `{ error: string, message: string }`

- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS
  - Files organized per unified project structure
  - Type definitions centralized in `types/invoice.ts`
  - Proper separation of hooks, components, and API layer

- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ PASS
  - Manual testing checklist provided covering all acceptance criteria
  - Backend has comprehensive test suite for invoice generation
  - Acceptable for MVP per tech stack decision (automated frontend tests planned for future)

- **All ACs Met**: ✅ YES
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verifiable

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed type safety issue in error parsing (InvoicePreview.tsx:82)
- [ ] Consider adding Vitest component tests for InvoiceGenerationDialog state machine (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider parallelizing invoice URL fetching for better performance with many invoices (future optimization)
- [ ] Consider adding structured logging (Winston/Pino) for audit trail instead of console.log (future enhancement)

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

- All invoice endpoints protected with `requireAuth` middleware
- Xero API credentials stored encrypted (verified in XeroConnection model)
- External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- CSRF protection via express-session
- Input validation on backend via express-validator
- No sensitive data exposed in frontend error messages

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✅ PASS**

- React Query caching reduces redundant API calls
- Frontend build optimized (665KB minified → 194KB gzipped)
- Xero API rate limit handling with Retry-After header
- Database transactions ensure atomicity
- Sequential URL fetching is acceptable for typical invoice counts (5-20), could be parallelized for future optimization

### Files Modified During Review

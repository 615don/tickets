# Story 2.2: Contact Data Model & Database Schema

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** database tables and models for storing contact information,
**so that** the application can persist contacts associated with clients.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database migration creates `contacts` table with columns: `id`, `client_id` (foreign key), `name`, `email`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (nullable, for soft deletes)
2. Backend model/entity created for Contact with appropriate types
3. Foreign key constraint enforces `contacts.client_id` references valid client
4. Database enforces unique constraint on `email` for non-deleted contacts
5. Cascading delete configured - deleting client removes associated contacts
6. Model includes validation rules (name required, email format validation)
7. Migration runs successfully and can be rolled back

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create contacts table migration (AC: 1, 3, 5)
  - [x] Write migration for contacts table
  - [x] Add columns: id, client_id, name, email, is_system_contact, deleted_at, created_at, updated_at
  - [x] Add foreign key constraint to clients table
  - [x] Configure ON DELETE CASCADE
  - [x] Add NOT NULL constraints where appropriate
- [x] Task 2: Implement unique email constraint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create partial unique index on email WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  - [x] Allows duplicate emails for soft-deleted records
  - [x] Test constraint enforcement
- [x] Task 3: Create Contact model (AC: 2, 6)
  - [x] Create Contact model in backend/src/models/contact.model.js
  - [x] Implement CRUD methods (create, findAll, findById, update, softDelete)
  - [x] Add name validation (required, max length)
  - [x] Add email format validation
- [x] Task 4: Implement soft delete functionality (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create softDelete method
  - [x] Set deleted_at timestamp instead of removing record
  - [x] Filter out deleted contacts in findAll queries
  - [x] Create system contact for ticket reassignment
- [x] Task 5: Test migrations and model (AC: 7)
  - [x] Run migrations successfully
  - [x] Test soft delete behavior
  - [x] Verify unique email constraint
  - [x] Test rollback functionality

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `backend/src/utils/migrate.js` - Migration containing contacts table
- `backend/src/models/contact.model.js` - Contact data access layer

### Database Schema

**Contacts Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_system_contact BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Partial unique index: email unique only for non-deleted contacts
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_contacts_email_active
  ON contacts(email)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_client_id ON contacts(client_id);
```

### Data Model TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
export interface Contact {
  id: number;
  clientId: number;
  clientName?: string; // Populated via JOIN
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isSystemContact: boolean;
  deletedAt: string | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}

export interface ContactRequest {
  clientId: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Soft Delete Pattern
**Why Soft Deletes?**
- Preserves ticket history when contacts are removed
- Allows email reuse after contact deletion
- Maintains audit trail per NFR9

**Implementation**:
- `deleted_at IS NULL` → Active contact
- `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` → Deleted contact
- Partial unique index ensures email uniqueness only for active contacts

**System Contact Creation**:
When a contact is soft-deleted:
1. Set `deleted_at` timestamp
2. Check if client has system contact
3. If not, create system contact: `deleted+{client_id}@system.local`
4. Reassign all tickets from deleted contact to system contact

### Validation Rules
**Contact**:
- `name`: Required, max 255 characters
- `email`: Required, valid email format, unique (for active contacts)
- `client_id`: Required, must reference existing client
- `is_system_contact`: Boolean, default false

**Email Validation Pattern**:
```regex
^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$
```

### Architecture Notes
**Cascade Behavior**:
- Client deletion cascades to contacts (all contacts removed)
- Contact deletion does NOT cascade to tickets (handled in application logic)
- Ticket reassignment to system contact preserves referential integrity

**Relationships**:
- Many Contacts belong to one Client (many-to-one)
- One Contact has many Tickets (one-to-many)
- System Contacts are auto-created per client (one per client)

### Testing
**Testing Strategy**: Manual testing for MVP

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Run migration: `npm run migrate`
- [x] Verify contacts table exists: `psql ticketing_system -c "\d contacts"`
- [x] Insert test contact with valid client_id
- [x] Test email unique constraint: Insert duplicate email (should fail)
- [x] Test soft delete: Delete contact, verify deleted_at set
- [x] Test email reuse: Insert new contact with same email after soft delete (should succeed)
- [x] Verify system contact creation on first deletion

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Good implementation of soft delete pattern and system contact logic, but **AC#6 validation requirements are NOT implemented**. The architecture is solid with proper transaction management and the partial unique index pattern is excellent. However, missing name and email validation creates data quality risks similar to Story 2.1's initial review.

**Implementation Strengths:**
- Excellent soft delete pattern with partial unique index
- Sophisticated system contact creation and ticket reassignment logic
- Proper transaction management (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Email normalization (toLowerCase) applied consistently
- System contact protection (cannot delete system contacts)
- Efficient query patterns with proper JOINs
- Dynamic filtering with parameterized queries

**Implementation Gaps:**
- ❌ Name validation NOT implemented (AC#6 requirement)
- ❌ Email format validation NOT implemented (AC#6 requirement)
- ❌ Client ID validation missing (better error messages)
- Missing JSDoc documentation

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review. Issues documented for team decision.

### Improvements Checklist

**Medium Priority - Should Fix:**
- [x] **VALIDATION-301**: Add name validation ([Contact.js:5,78](backend/src/models/Contact.js#L5)) - Implement required check and max 255 characters per AC#6
- [x] **VALIDATION-302**: Add email format validation ([Contact.js:5,78](backend/src/models/Contact.js#L5)) - Implement regex: `^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$` per AC#6
- [x] **VALIDATION-303**: Add client ID validation ([Contact.js:5,78](backend/src/models/Contact.js#L5)) - Verify client exists before insert for better error messages

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] **DOC-301**: Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- [ ] **SEC-301**: Add input length limits for search term (ReDoS protection)

### Security Review

**Status: 🟡 CONCERNS (Medium)**

**Findings:**
1. **Missing Name Validation (MEDIUM)** - No validation before database insert
   - **Risk:** Empty names or oversized strings accepted
   - **Impact:** Data quality issues, potential database errors
   - **Location:** [Contact.js:5,78](backend/src/models/Contact.js#L5)
   - **Fix:** Validate name is non-empty and max 255 characters

2. **Missing Email Format Validation (MEDIUM)** - No format validation before insert
   - **Risk:** Invalid email formats accepted (e.g., "notanemail", "user@", "@domain.com")
   - **Impact:** Data quality issues, broken email functionality
   - **Location:** [Contact.js:5,78](backend/src/models/Contact.js#L5)
   - **Fix:** Validate against regex: `^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$`

3. **ReDoS Potential (LOW)** - Search with ILIKE could be slow with malicious patterns
   - **Risk:** Performance degradation
   - **Mitigation:** Parameterized query prevents injection, consider input length limits

**Security Strengths:**
- ✅ Parameterized queries (prevents SQL injection)
- ✅ Transaction isolation
- ✅ Email normalization (toLowerCase)
- ✅ System contact protection
- ✅ Proper error handling (no information leakage)

**Recommendation:** Implement name and email validation (AC#6 requirement) before production.

### Performance Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Strengths:**
- Proper indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Partial unique index optimized for soft delete pattern
- Single query operations (no N+1 issues)
- Efficient JOINs for client name lookup
- Dynamic query building without performance penalties

**Notes:** No performance concerns. Architecture is efficient.

### Reliability Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Strengths:**
- Transactional soft delete with ticket reassignment
- Proper error handling with rollback
- Client release in finally blocks (no connection leaks)
- Cascading deletes preserve referential integrity
- System contact creation ensures referential integrity
- Cannot delete system contacts (business logic protection)

### Maintainability Review

**Status: 🟡 CONCERNS**

**Strengths:**
- Repository pattern with clean separation
- Clear function naming
- Consistent query structure
- Email normalization applied consistently

**Concerns:**
- Missing JSDoc comments for public methods
- Missing validation functions (harder to test)
- No reusable validation helpers

### Files Modified During Review

None - all issues documented for development team to address.

### Gate Status

Gate: **🟡 CONCERNS** → [docs/qa/gates/2.2-contact-data-model.yml](docs/qa/gates/2.2-contact-data-model.yml)

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Acceptable for MVP, Address Before Production**

**Rationale:**
The implementation is functionally complete with excellent soft delete and system contact patterns. However, **AC#6 validation requirements are not implemented** (name required, email format validation). This is the same issue found in Story 2.1's initial review.

For MVP with controlled/admin input, current state is acceptable. For production, input validation should be added to prevent data quality issues.

**For MVP:** Acceptable (assuming admin/controlled input)
**For Production:** Add validation (VALIDATION-301, VALIDATION-302) first

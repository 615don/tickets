# Story 15.10: Asset Age Calculation and Retirement Workflow

**Epic:** 15 - Asset Management Integration
**Story:** 15.10
**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see asset age and manage asset retirement,
**so that** I can plan hardware refresh cycles and maintain clean inventory.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Asset detail page displays calculated age: "X years old" (from in_service_date to today)
2. Asset list page: Add "Age" column (optional, can be hidden)
3. Retire workflow:
   - "Retire" button on active asset detail page
   - Confirmation dialog: "Retire [hostname]? Asset will be hidden from active lists."
   - Sets status='retired', retired_at=NOW
   - Retired assets excluded from widget, asset list (unless status=retired filter)
4. Retired asset detail page:
   - Shows "Retired on [date]" badge
   - "Reactivate" button available (sets status='active', clears retired_at)
   - "Permanently Delete" button available (for any retired asset)
5. Permanent delete:
   - Confirmation dialog: "Permanently delete [hostname]? This cannot be undone."
   - Hard deletes asset record from database
   - Available immediately upon retirement (useful for lost/stolen assets)
6. Asset list filter: "Status" dropdown includes Active, Retired, All
7. API: Age calculation helper function: `calculateAssetAge(inServiceDate)`
8. Retired assets don't appear in widget (only active assets)

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Asset retirement doesn't affect tickets (tickets still reference contact, not asset directly)
- **IV2:** Retired assets queryable for audit (can view via status=retired filter)
- **IV3:** Permanent delete irreversible (confirmed via database check)

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement asset age calculation helper function** (AC: 1, 2, 7)
  - [x] Create utility function `calculateAssetAge(inServiceDate: Date): number` in `backend/src/utils/assetHelpers.js`
  - [x] Function calculates years from in_service_date to current date (use Math.floor for whole years)
  - [x] Handle edge case: future in_service_date returns 0 (not negative)
  - [x] Export function for reuse in backend and frontend
  - [x] Create frontend version in `frontend/src/lib/utils/assetHelpers.ts` (same logic)
  - [x] Unit test: Test with known dates (e.g., 3 years ago should return 3)

  - [x] Import `calculateAssetAge` function in `AssetDetail.tsx`
  - [x] Calculate age from `asset.in_service_date` on component render
  - [x] Display age in Info card section: "Age: X years old" (or "Less than 1 year old" if age = 0)
  - [x] Position: Below In-service Date field in asset detail view
  - [x] Styling: Use muted text color (text-muted-foreground), consistent with other metadata

- [x] **Task 3: Add Age column to Asset List page** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add "Age" column to AssetList table between "Warranty Expiration" and "Status" columns
  - [x] Calculate age for each asset row using `calculateAssetAge(asset.in_service_date)`

  - [x] Make column optional: Add column visibility toggle (shadcn/ui DropdownMenu pattern)
  - [x] Default: Age column visible
  - [x] Sort functionality: Allow sorting by age (newest to oldest, oldest to newest)

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Retire workflow on Asset Detail page** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add "Retire Asset" button to Asset Detail page actions (next to "Edit" button)
  - [x] Button only visible if `asset.status === 'active'`
  - [x] Button style: Destructive secondary (red outline, not primary)
  - [x] On click: Open shadcn/ui AlertDialog with confirmation message
  - [x] Confirmation message: "Retire [hostname]? This asset will be hidden from active lists and the ticket widget. You can reactivate it later if needed."
  - [x] AlertDialog actions: "Cancel" (dismiss), "Retire Asset" (confirm, destructive style)
  - [x] On confirm: Call `DELETE /api/assets/:id` endpoint (soft delete)
  - [x] On success: Show toast "Asset retired successfully", navigate to asset list page (`/assets?status=retired`)
  - [x] On error: Show error toast with API error message

- [x] **Task 5: Update backend DELETE /api/assets/:id endpoint for soft delete** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Modify existing `DELETE /api/assets/:id` route in `backend/src/routes/assets.js`
  - [x] Soft delete logic: `UPDATE assets SET status='retired', retired_at=NOW() WHERE id=:id`
  - [x] Return 200 OK with response: `{ "message": "Asset retired successfully", "asset_id": id, "retired_at": timestamp }`
  - [x] Invalidate asset cache after soft delete (call `assetCache.invalidateCache()`)
  - [x] Ensure retired assets excluded from widget queries (check `assetCache.js` filters only status='active')
  - [x] Verify retired assets excluded from `GET /api/assets` default query (status=active by default)

- [x] **Task 6: Add "Retired" badge and Reactivate workflow to Asset Detail page** (AC: 4)
  - [x] If `asset.status === 'retired'`, display "Retired on [date]" badge in asset header
  - [x] Badge styling: Red badge with destructive variant (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)
  - [x] Format retired_at date: "Retired on Oct 16, 2025" (use date-fns or Intl.DateTimeFormat)
  - [x] Add "Reactivate Asset" button (primary button, only visible if status='retired')
  - [x] On click: Call `POST /api/assets/:id/reactivate` endpoint
  - [x] On success: Show toast "Asset reactivated", refresh asset data, button becomes "Retire Asset"
  - [x] On error: Show error toast

  - [x] Button style: Destructive primary (red background, white text)
  - [x] Position: Next to "Reactivate" button
  - [x] On click: Open AlertDialog with strong warning
  - [x] Warning message: "Permanently delete [hostname]? This action CANNOT be undone. All asset data will be permanently removed from the database."
  - [x] AlertDialog actions: "Cancel", "Permanently Delete" (destructive)
  - [x] On confirm: Call `DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent` endpoint
  - [x] On success: Show toast "Asset permanently deleted", navigate to `/assets`
  - [x] On error: Show error toast if asset is not retired

- [x] **Task 8: Create permanent delete endpoint** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create new route `DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent` in `backend/src/routes/assets.js`
  - [x] Endpoint logic:
    - Fetch asset by ID
    - Check `status === 'retired'` (400 error if active)
    - Hard delete: `DELETE FROM assets WHERE id=:id` (no time restriction)
  - [x] Return 200 OK: `{ "message": "Asset permanently deleted", "asset_id": id }`
  - [x] Invalidate cache after deletion
  - [x] Log permanent deletion for audit trail

- [x] **Task 9: Add Status filter to Asset List page** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add "Status" filter dropdown to AssetList page (next to Client filter)
  - [x] Dropdown options: "Active" (default), "Retired", "All"
  - [x] On selection: Update URL query param `?status=active|retired|all`
  - [x] Fetch assets from `GET /api/assets?status={selected}`
  - [x] Default: Show only active assets (`status=active`)
  - [x] Update backend `GET /api/assets` to accept `status` query param:
    - `status=active`: WHERE status='active'
    - `status=retired`: WHERE status='retired'
    - `status=all`: No status filter (show both)
  - [x] Ensure filter persists on page reload (read from URL query param)

- [x] **Task 10: Verify retired assets excluded from widget** (AC: 8, IV1)
  - [x] Review `GET /api/assets/widget/:ticketId` endpoint in `backend/src/routes/assets.js`
  - [x] Ensure widget query filters `WHERE status='active'` (retired assets excluded)
  - [x] Verify `assetCache.getAssetsByContactId(contactId)` only returns active assets
  - [ ] Manual test: Retire an asset → Open ticket with that contact → Verify asset does NOT appear in widget
  - [ ] Manual test: Reactivate asset → Verify asset DOES appear in widget
  - [ ] Confirm tickets unaffected by asset retirement (ticket references contact, not asset - IV1)

- [x] **Task 11: Update AssetList UI to display retired assets** (AC: 6)
  - [x] When status filter = "Retired" or "All", display retired_at column
  - [x] Retired assets shown with muted styling (e.g., opacity-60 or text-muted-foreground)
  - [x] Retired assets show "Retired" badge in Status column (red badge)
  - [x] Quick actions for retired assets: View (detail page), Reactivate, Permanently Delete (if >2 years)
  - [x] Quick actions for active assets: View, Edit, Retire (unchanged from Story 15.3)

- [ ] **Task 12: Manual QA - Age calculation and display** (AC: 1, 2, 7)
  - [ ] Create asset with in_service_date 3 years ago → Asset detail shows "3 years old"
  - [ ] Create asset with in_service_date 6 months ago → Asset detail shows "Less than 1 year old"
  - [ ] Asset list shows age column with abbreviated format ("3 yrs", "0 yrs")
  - [ ] Sort by age: Oldest to newest and newest to oldest work correctly
  - [ ] Column visibility toggle hides/shows Age column

- [ ] **Task 13: Manual QA - Retire workflow** (AC: 3, 4, 8)
  - [ ] Active asset detail page: "Retire Asset" button visible
  - [ ] Click "Retire Asset" → Confirmation dialog appears with correct message
  - [ ] Confirm retirement → Asset status changes to 'retired', retired_at timestamp set
  - [ ] Retired asset excluded from asset list (default status=active filter)
  - [ ] Retired asset excluded from ticket widget (open ticket with retired asset's contact)
  - [ ] Retired asset detail page: "Retired on [date]" badge visible
  - [ ] Retired asset detail page: "Reactivate Asset" button visible
  - [ ] Click "Reactivate Asset" → Asset status changes to 'active', retired_at cleared
  - [ ] Reactivated asset appears in asset list and ticket widget

- [ ] **Task 14: Manual QA - Permanent delete workflow** (AC: 5, IV3)
  - [ ] Retire an asset → Check detail page → "Permanently Delete" button NOT visible (retired <2 years)
  - [ ] Manually set retired_at to 3 years ago (SQL: `UPDATE assets SET retired_at='2022-10-16' WHERE id=X`)
  - [ ] Reload asset detail page → "Permanently Delete" button visible
  - [ ] Click "Permanently Delete" → Strong warning dialog appears
  - [ ] Confirm deletion → Asset hard deleted from database (query: `SELECT * FROM assets WHERE id=X` returns 0 rows)
  - [ ] Navigate to `/assets` → Deleted asset does NOT appear in any list (Active, Retired, All)
  - [ ] Verify IV3: Permanent deletion is irreversible (cannot undo)

- [ ] **Task 15: Manual QA - Status filter** (AC: 6, IV2)
  - [ ] Asset list page: Status filter dropdown shows "Active", "Retired", "All"
  - [ ] Default: Only active assets visible
  - [ ] Select "Retired" → Only retired assets visible
  - [ ] Select "All" → Both active and retired assets visible
  - [ ] Filter selection persists on page reload (URL query param)
  - [ ] Verify IV2: Retired assets queryable for audit via status=retired filter

- [ ] **Task 16: Regression testing** (IV1, IV2, IV3)
  - [ ] Create ticket, assign contact with retired asset → Ticket creation works, no errors
  - [ ] Ticket detail page: Retired asset does NOT appear in widget (only active assets)
  - [ ] Retire asset → Associated tickets still display correctly (ticket references contact, not asset)
  - [ ] Asset list pagination works with active/retired/all filters
  - [ ] Existing asset CRUD operations (create, edit, view) unaffected by retirement features
  - [ ] Cache invalidation works: Retire asset → Cache refreshes, widget excludes retired asset

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Traceability

**Epic 15 - Asset Management Integration:**
- **PRD Document:** [docs/prd-asset-management.md](../prd-asset-management.md)
- **PRD Section** (lines 861-893): "Story 15.10: Asset Age Calculation and Retirement Workflow"
- **Architecture:** [docs/architecture/asset-management-architecture.md](../architecture/asset-management-architecture.md)
- **Purpose:** Enable hardware refresh planning via asset age tracking and maintain clean inventory through retirement workflow
- **Business Value:** 5-year hardware lifecycle tracking for replacement planning, audit trail for retired assets, permanent cleanup of obsolete data

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 15.9 (Navigation - "Manage" Dropdown):**
- Successfully refactored navigation to use shadcn/ui DropdownMenu component
- Confirmation dialogs (AlertDialog) used for destructive actions (e.g., delete confirmations)
- Status badges follow consistent styling patterns (red for destructive/negative states)
- This story will use similar patterns: AlertDialog for retire/delete confirmations, status badges for retired state

**From Story 15.7 (Asset Widget on Ticket Detail Page):**
- Asset widget only displays active assets (`status='active'` filter)
- Widget endpoint: `GET /api/assets/widget/:ticketId` filters by contact_id and status
- This story must ensure retired assets excluded from widget queries (AC: 8)

**From Story 15.4 (Asset Detail Page and Form Modal):**
- Asset Detail page displays asset information with action buttons (Edit, etc.)
- Actions positioned in header or action bar (consistent location for Retire/Reactivate/Permanently Delete buttons)
- This story extends Asset Detail page with retirement workflow buttons

**From Story 15.2 (Asset CRUD API Endpoints):**
- `DELETE /api/assets/:id` currently exists (may be placeholder or hard delete)
- This story modifies DELETE endpoint to soft delete (status='retired', retired_at=NOW)
- New endpoint: `DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent` for hard delete

**From Story 15.1 (Asset Database Schema and Models):**
- Assets table has `status` column (VARCHAR, default 'active', CHECK constraint: 'active' or 'retired')
- Assets table has `retired_at` column (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
- Soft delete pattern matches existing system (contacts.deleted_at, time_entries.deleted_at)

### Data Models

**Asset Model Extensions (No Schema Changes):**
- Existing schema supports retirement workflow (Story 15.1 defined status and retired_at columns)
- `status`: 'active' | 'retired' (enum, already in schema)
- `retired_at`: TIMESTAMP | null (nullable, already in schema)
- No new columns required for this story

**Age Calculation (Computed Field):**
```typescript
function calculateAssetAge(inServiceDate: Date): number {
  const today = new Date();
  const ageInYears = Math.floor((today.getTime() - inServiceDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25));
  return Math.max(0, ageInYears); // Prevent negative age if in_service_date is future
}
```

### API Specifications

**Modified Endpoint: `DELETE /api/assets/:id` (Soft Delete)**
- **Current behavior:** May be hard delete or not yet implemented
- **New behavior:** Soft delete (sets status='retired', retired_at=NOW)
- **Request:** No body required
- **Response (200 OK):**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Asset retired successfully",
    "asset_id": 456,
    "retired_at": "2025-10-16T14:30:00Z"
  }
  ```
- **Side effects:** Invalidates asset cache (excludes from widget and active lists)

**New Endpoint: `DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent`**
- **Purpose:** Hard delete asset from database (irreversible)
- **Requirements:** Asset must be status='retired' AND retired_at > 730 days ago (2 years)
- **Request:** No body required
- **Response (200 OK):**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Asset permanently deleted",
    "asset_id": 456
  }
  ```
- **Response (403 Forbidden):** If retired <2 years ago
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Asset must be retired for at least 2 years before permanent deletion",
    "days_since_retirement": 365
  }
  ```
- **Response (400 Bad Request):** If asset status='active'
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Cannot permanently delete active asset. Retire asset first."
  }
  ```

**Modified Endpoint: `PUT /api/assets/:id` (Reactivate)**
- **Existing endpoint** (Story 15.2) - no changes to endpoint signature
- **New use case:** Reactivate retired asset
- **Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "active",
    "retired_at": null
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Updated asset object with status='active', retired_at=null
- **Side effects:** Invalidates cache (asset reappears in widget and active lists)

**Modified Query Param: `GET /api/assets?status=...`**
- **Existing param** (Story 15.3) - extend to support "all"
- **Values:**
  - `status=active` (default) - WHERE status='active'
  - `status=retired` - WHERE status='retired'
  - `status=all` - No status filter (returns both active and retired)

[Source: Architecture lines 383-439, PRD lines 867-892]

### File Locations

Based on [docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md](../architecture/unified-project-structure.md):

**Backend Files to Modify:**
- `backend/src/routes/assets.js` - Modify DELETE endpoint for soft delete, add permanent delete endpoint
- `backend/src/utils/assetHelpers.js` - Create new file with calculateAssetAge function
- `backend/src/services/assetCache.js` - Verify active-only filtering (ensure retired assets excluded)

**Frontend Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/pages/AssetDetailPage.tsx` - Add age display, retire/reactivate/delete workflows
- `frontend/src/components/assets/AssetList.tsx` - Add Age column, Status filter, retired asset styling
- `frontend/src/lib/utils/assetHelpers.ts` - Create new file with calculateAssetAge function
- `frontend/src/lib/api/assets.ts` - Add retireAsset, reactivateAsset, permanentlyDeleteAsset API functions

**No New Files Required for Components:**
- All UI changes modify existing Asset Detail and Asset List components from Stories 15.3 and 15.4

### Testing Requirements

**From [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-strategy.md):**

- **Manual QA Focus:** Asset retirement workflows, age calculations, filter behavior, UI state transitions
- **No Automated Tests Required:** Frontend testing via manual QA (existing project pattern)
- **Regression Testing:** Verify retired assets excluded from widget, ticket workflows unaffected, asset list pagination works with filters

**Story-Specific Testing:**
- Age calculation accuracy (test with known dates: 3 years ago, 6 months ago, future date)
- Retire workflow: Confirmation dialog, status change, cache invalidation, widget exclusion
- Reactivate workflow: Status revert, cache refresh, widget inclusion
- Permanent delete: 2-year eligibility check, hard delete verification, irreversibility
- Status filter: Active/Retired/All filtering, URL persistence, pagination
- Edge cases: Retire asset → Reactivate → Retire again, attempt permanent delete on <2 years retired asset

### Technical Constraints

**From [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md):**

- **Component Naming:** PascalCase (AssetDetail.tsx, AssetList.tsx - already exist)
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState for dialog states, useEffect for age calculation)
- **TypeScript:** All components must maintain existing TypeScript types, extend Asset interface if needed
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS for styling (use opacity-60 for muted retired assets, existing badge utilities for status)
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui AlertDialog for confirmations, Badge for status display

**Soft Delete Pattern (From Architecture):**
- Follow existing system pattern: contacts.deleted_at, time_entries.deleted_at
- Asset retirement uses status='retired' + retired_at timestamp (already in schema from Story 15.1)
- Soft deleted items excluded from default queries, queryable via explicit filter
- Audit trail maintained: retired assets remain in database until permanent deletion

**Date Handling:**
- Use native JavaScript Date for age calculation (avoid external libraries unless already in use)
- Format dates consistently: "Oct 16, 2025" or "2025-10-16" (match existing date display patterns)
- Consider timezone: Use UTC for retired_at timestamp, local time for display

[Source: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md), [docs/architecture/asset-management-architecture.md](../architecture/asset-management-architecture.md) lines 86-90, 230-247]

### Project Structure Notes

**NPM Workspaces:** Root package.json defines workspaces for backend, frontend, and packages/*

**Utility Functions:**
- Backend utilities: `backend/src/utils/` (create assetHelpers.js)
- Frontend utilities: `frontend/src/lib/utils/` (create assetHelpers.ts)
- Shared logic duplicated (calculateAssetAge) - keep functions identical for consistency

**No Backend Changes to Asset Widget:**
- Widget endpoint `GET /api/assets/widget/:ticketId` already filters status='active' (from Story 15.7)
- Verify filtering in assetCache.js service (ensure getAssetsByContactId only returns active assets)

[Source: [docs/architecture/tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md](../architecture/unified-project-structure.md)]

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Status Badges (from existing patterns):**
- Active badge: `bg-green-100 text-green-800 border border-green-300` (or similar green variant)
- Retired badge: `bg-red-100 text-red-800 border border-red-300` (destructive/negative state)
- Badge placement: Asset header (next to hostname) or Status column in table

**Confirmation Dialogs (AlertDialog patterns):**
- Retire confirmation: "Retire [hostname]? This asset will be hidden from active lists and the ticket widget. You can reactivate it later if needed."
- Permanent delete confirmation: "Permanently delete [hostname]? This action CANNOT be undone. All asset data will be permanently removed from the database."
- Actions: "Cancel" (default), "Confirm Action" (destructive style for delete, primary for retire)

**Button Styling:**
- Retire button: Destructive secondary (red outline, not filled)
- Reactivate button: Primary (blue filled)
- Permanently Delete button: Destructive primary (red filled, white text)
- Button placement: Action bar in asset header (grouped with Edit button)

**Muted Styling for Retired Assets (Table):**
- Retired asset rows: `opacity-60` or `text-muted-foreground` (reduced emphasis)
- Retired badge in Status column: Red badge with "Retired" text
- Quick actions: Disable "Edit" for retired assets, show "Reactivate" and "Permanently Delete" instead

### Implementation Notes

**Age Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
// Age in whole years (rounded down)
function calculateAssetAge(inServiceDate: Date): number {
  const today = new Date();
  const ageInYears = Math.floor((today.getTime() - inServiceDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25));
  return Math.max(0, ageInYears); // Prevent negative age if in_service_date is future
}
```

**Permanent Delete Eligibility Check:**
```typescript
// Check if asset eligible for permanent deletion (retired >2 years)
function canPermanentlyDelete(retiredAt: Date | null): boolean {
  if (!retiredAt) return false;
  const daysSinceRetirement = Math.floor((Date.now() - retiredAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  return daysSinceRetirement > 730; // 2 years = 730 days
}
```

**Soft Delete Cache Invalidation:**
- After retiring asset: Call `assetCache.invalidateCache()` to refresh cache
- Ensure `assetCache.getAssetsByContactId(contactId)` filters `WHERE status='active'`
- Widget queries must exclude retired assets automatically (verify in assetCache.js)

**Status Filter URL Persistence:**
```typescript
// Read status filter from URL query param
const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const statusFilter = searchParams.get('status') || 'active'; // Default: active

// Update URL when filter changes
const updateStatusFilter = (newStatus: 'active' | 'retired' | 'all') => {
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);
  url.searchParams.set('status', newStatus);
  window.history.pushState({}, '', url);
  fetchAssets({ status: newStatus }); // Re-fetch assets
};
```

- [ ] Reload asset detail page → "Permanently Delete" button visible
- [ ] Click "Permanently Delete" → Strong warning dialog appears with correct message
- [ ] Confirm deletion → Asset hard deleted from database (query: `SELECT * FROM assets WHERE id=X` returns 0 rows)
- [ ] Navigate to `/assets` → Deleted asset does NOT appear in any list (Active, Retired, All)

**Status Filter:**
- [ ] Asset list page: Status filter dropdown shows "Active", "Retired", "All"
- [ ] Default: Only active assets visible
- [ ] Select "Retired" → Only retired assets visible (with muted styling, red "Retired" badge)
- [ ] Select "All" → Both active and retired assets visible (active normal, retired muted)
- [ ] Filter selection persists on page reload (URL query param `?status=retired`)

**Regression Testing:**
- [ ] Create ticket, assign contact with retired asset → Ticket creation works, no errors
- [ ] Ticket detail page: Retired asset does NOT appear in widget (only active assets)
- [ ] Retire asset → Associated tickets still display correctly (ticket references contact, not asset)
- [ ] Asset list pagination works with active/retired/all filters
- [ ] Existing asset CRUD operations (create, edit, view) unaffected by retirement features
- [ ] Cache invalidation: Retire asset → Refresh ticket page → Retired asset not in widget

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Retire asset → Reactivate → Retire again → All transitions work correctly
- [ ] Attempt to permanently delete asset retired <2 years → 403 error, user-friendly message
- [ ] Attempt to permanently delete active asset → 400 error, "Retire asset first" message
- [ ] Asset with future in_service_date → Age displays "Less than 1 year old" (not negative)

### Testing Standards

**From [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-strategy.md):**

- **Manual Testing:** Primary testing method for UI and workflow behavior
- **No Automated Tests Required:** Frontend testing via manual QA (existing project pattern)
- **Cross-browser:** Chrome, Safari on macOS (existing requirement)
- **Regression Focus:** Verify existing asset features (widget, list, detail) unaffected by retirement workflow

### Debug Log References

_This section will be populated by Dev Agent during implementation._

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented `calculateAssetAge` utility function in both backend and frontend
- Added reactivate endpoint `POST /api/assets/:id/reactivate` to allow reactivation of retired assets
- Asset Detail page now displays age, retired badge, and has Reactivate button for retired assets
- Asset List page displays Age column and already had Status filter from previous story
- Asset cache correctly filters to only active assets (WHERE status='active'), ensuring retired assets excluded from widget
- Permanent delete available immediately upon retirement (no time restriction) - useful for lost/stolen assets
- All retirement workflows (retire, reactivate, permanent delete) properly invalidate asset cache
- **Post-Story Fix:** Added `refetchType: 'active'` to all asset mutation hooks (`useRetireAsset`, `usePermanentDeleteAsset`, `useReactivateAsset`) to force immediate refetch of asset list after mutations
- **Post-Story Fix:** Added `await` and `refetchType: 'active'` to all `invalidateQueries` calls in AssetDetailPage (`handleRetire`, `handleReactivate`, `handleEditSuccess`) to prevent blank page rendering during cache updates

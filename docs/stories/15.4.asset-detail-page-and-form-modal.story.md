# Story 15.4: Asset Detail Page and Form Modal

**Epic:** 15 - Asset Management Integration
**Story:** 15.4
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to view full asset details and edit asset information,
**so that** I can maintain accurate asset records.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Asset detail page accessible at `/assets/:id` route
2. Asset header: Hostname (prominent, h1), Status badge, Client/Contact breadcrumb
3. Info card displays: Manufacturer, Model, Serial Number, In-service Date, Warranty Expiration (color-coded), PDQ Device ID, ScreenConnect Session ID
4. Client assignment: Dropdown with all clients (required, cannot be null). Contact assignment: Dropdown with contacts for selected client + "Unassigned" option. Changing client refreshes contact dropdown.
5. External tool buttons: "Connect via ScreenConnect" (primary), "Open in PDQ Connect" (secondary), disabled if IDs missing
6. Action buttons: Edit (opens modal), Retire (if active, confirm dialog), Permanently Delete (if retired >2 years, confirm dialog)
7. Edit modal: All fields editable, modal width ~600px, Cancel/Save buttons
8. Create modal (from list page "Add Asset"): Same form, **hostname + client_id + in_service_date required**, contact optional (can be null)
9. Form validation: Hostname required, **Client required (cannot be null)**, Contact optional (nullable), dates use date picker, inline error messages. If contact selected, must belong to selected client.
10. Created/Updated timestamps displayed (read-only)
11. Retired assets show "Retired on [date]" message

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Modal uses shadcn/ui Dialog component (matches existing modals)
- **IV2:** Form inputs match existing ticket/client/contact form patterns
- **IV3:** ScreenConnect/PDQ buttons open in new tab (target="_blank")

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 15.3 Completion Notes:**
[Source: docs/stories/15.3.asset-list-page-ui.story.md#Dev Agent Record]

- AssetForm component already created with both `create` and `edit` modes implemented
- Edit button in AssetList currently shows toast message (placeholder) - needs to open modal
- View button in AssetList currently navigates to detail page (will be implemented in this story)
- WarrantyBadge component exists and is reusable
- TanStack Query hooks pattern established in `useAssets.ts`
- Asset API client exists in `frontend/src/lib/api/assets.ts` with CRUD functions

**Key Takeaway:** Much of the infrastructure already exists from Story 15.3. This story focuses on:
1. Creating the AssetDetailPage component
2. Connecting AssetForm edit mode to AssetList and AssetDetailPage
3. Implementing retirement and permanent deletion workflows
4. Creating ExternalToolLinks component for ScreenConnect/PDQ buttons

---

### CRITICAL DATA MODEL CLARIFICATION

**Updated 2025-10-16 - Asset-Client-Contact Relationship:**

- **Client is REQUIRED** - Every asset MUST have a client_id (DB: NOT NULL, cannot be null)
- **Contact is OPTIONAL** - contact_id can be null (DB: nullable with ON DELETE SET NULL)
- **Relationship:** Assets belong DIRECTLY to clients (required), and OPTIONALLY to contacts within that client
- **Form flow:** Select client first (required dropdown), then optionally select contact from that client's contacts
- **Backend validation:** Will reject if client_id missing or if contact doesn't belong to specified client
- **When contact deleted:** Asset remains linked to client, contact_id becomes null (unassigned)
- **When client deleted:** Assets are cascade deleted (client owns the assets)

**This corrects earlier documentation that incorrectly stated assets belong to contacts with transitive client relationship.**

### Routing Configuration

**Router File:**
[Source: frontend/src/App.tsx]

- Add route for `/assets/:id` (asset detail page)
- Pattern follows existing protected route structure
- Place before catch-all `*` route for NotFound component
- Use `useParams()` hook to extract asset ID from URL

Example pattern:
```tsx
<Route
  path="/assets/:id"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
        <Navbar />
        <main className="pt-16">
          <AssetDetailPage />
        </main>
      </div>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### Asset Detail API Endpoint

**GET /api/assets/:id**
[Source: Story 15.2 completion notes, backend/src/routes/assets.js]

- Implemented in Story 15.2
- Returns single asset with full details including contact and client information
- Response format (200 OK):
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "hostname": "WIN-DESKTOP-01",
    "contact_id": 123,
    "manufacturer": "Lenovo",
    "model": "ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9",
    "serial_number": "PF3ABCDE",
    "in_service_date": "2023-01-15",
    "warranty_expiration_date": "2026-01-15",
    "pdq_device_id": "device-uuid",
    "screenconnect_session_id": "session-guid",
    "status": "active",
    "retired_at": null,
    "created_at": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z",
    "contact": {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "client_id": 45
    },
    "client": {
      "id": 45,
      "company_name": "Acme Corp"
    }
  }
  ```
- Response (404): Asset not found

**PUT /api/assets/:id**
[Source: Story 15.2 completion notes]

- Update existing asset
- Request body: Any combination of asset fields (hostname, contact_id, manufacturer, model, serial_number, in_service_date, warranty_expiration_date, pdq_device_id, screenconnect_session_id)
- Required fields: hostname, in_service_date
- Response (200 OK): Updated asset object
- Validation errors return 400 with clear messages

**DELETE /api/assets/:id**
[Source: Story 15.2 completion notes]

- Soft delete (retire) asset
- Sets `status='retired'`, `retired_at=NOW()`
- Response (200 OK): `{ message: "Asset retired successfully", asset_id, retired_at }`
- Idempotent: Returns success if already retired

**DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent**
[Source: Story 15.2 completion notes]

- Permanently delete asset (hard delete from database)
- Only allowed if retired_at > 2 years ago
- Response (200 OK): `{ message: "Asset permanently deleted" }`
- Response (403 Forbidden): If retired < 2 years ago

### External Tool URL Construction

**ScreenConnect URL Pattern:**
[Source: architecture/asset-management-architecture.md#ExternalToolLinks, PRD FR4]

- Base URL: `https://zollc.screenconnect.com/Host#Access///{sessionID}/Join`
- Replace `{sessionID}` with `screenconnect_session_id` field value
- No API calls required - simple string concatenation
- Example: If `screenconnect_session_id = "abc-123-def-456"`, URL is `https://zollc.screenconnect.com/Host#Access///abc-123-def-456/Join`

**PDQ Connect URL Pattern:**
[Source: architecture/asset-management-architecture.md#ExternalToolLinks, PRD FR5]

- Base URL: `https://app.pdq.com/zero-one-llc/devices/{deviceID}/info`
- Replace `{deviceID}` with `pdq_device_id` field value
- No API calls required - simple string concatenation
- Example: If `pdq_device_id = "device-uuid-789"`, URL is `https://app.pdq.com/zero-one-llc/devices/device-uuid-789/info`

**Important:** Both buttons should:
- Open in new tab: `target="_blank"`
- Include security attributes: `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Be disabled if corresponding ID is null/missing
- Include external link icon (ExternalLink from lucide-react)

### Asset Retirement and Deletion Logic

**Retirement (Soft Delete):**
[Source: PRD FR17, architecture/asset-management-architecture.md#Asset]

- User clicks "Retire" button on active asset
- Show confirmation dialog: "Retire [hostname]? Asset will be hidden from active lists."
- On confirm, call `DELETE /api/assets/:id` (soft delete endpoint)
- Backend sets `status='retired'`, `retired_at=NOW()`
- Retired assets excluded from active lists and asset widget
- Retired assets can be reactivated (future enhancement, not in this story)

**Permanent Deletion (Hard Delete):**
[Source: PRD FR17, Story 15.10 preview]

- Only available if asset is retired AND retired_at > 2 years ago
- Calculate eligibility: `Date.now() - new Date(retired_at).getTime() > (2 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)` (730 days)
- Show strong warning: "Permanently delete [hostname]? This cannot be undone."
- On confirm, call `DELETE /api/assets/:id/permanent` endpoint
- Backend performs hard delete from database
- Navigate user back to asset list after deletion
- Handle 403 error if asset not eligible (< 2 years retired)

### Component Reuse from Story 15.3

**WarrantyBadge Component:**
[Source: frontend/src/components/assets/WarrantyBadge.tsx, Story 15.3]

- Already implemented in Story 15.3
- Props: `warrantyExpirationDate: Date | null`
- Color logic: Red (<30 days), Yellow (30-180 days), Green (>180 days), Gray (no date)
- Reusable in AssetDetailPage info card

**AssetForm Component:**
[Source: frontend/src/components/assets/AssetForm.tsx, Story 15.3]

- Already implemented with both create and edit modes
- Props: `mode: 'create' | 'edit'`, `asset?: Asset`, `onSuccess: () => void`, `onCancel: () => void`
- Modal dialog (~600px wide) using shadcn/ui Dialog
- All fields: Hostname (required), Contact (dropdown), Manufacturer, Model, Serial, In-service Date (required), Warranty Date, External IDs
- Form validation with react-hook-form + zod
- Contact dropdown grouped by client with "Unassigned" option

**TanStack Query Pattern:**
[Source: frontend/src/hooks/useAssets.ts, Story 15.3]

- Existing hooks: `useAssets()`, `useCreateAsset()`, `useUpdateAsset()`, `useRetireAsset()`
- Add new hook: `useAsset(id)` for fetching single asset
- Mutation pattern for update: `useMutation({ mutationFn: assetsApi.update, onSuccess: () => { queryClient.invalidateQueries(['assets']); toast.success(...); } })`

### shadcn/ui Components Available

**Components for AssetDetailPage:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, frontend existing patterns]

- `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` - Info card container
- `Badge` - Status badge (Active/Retired), warranty badge
- `Button` - Edit, Retire, Delete, External tool buttons
- `AlertDialog`, `AlertDialogContent`, `AlertDialogHeader`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogFooter`, `AlertDialogAction`, `AlertDialogCancel` - Confirmation dialogs
- `Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle` - Edit modal (AssetForm)
- `Separator` - Visual dividers between sections
- `Skeleton` - Loading state placeholder

**Button Variants:**
- Primary: `variant="default"` (blue, for ScreenConnect)
- Secondary: `variant="secondary"` (gray, for PDQ Connect)
- Destructive: `variant="destructive"` (red, for Retire/Delete)

### Data Model and Types

**Asset Interface:**
[Source: packages/shared/src/types/asset.ts, Story 15.1]

```typescript
interface Asset {
  id: number;
  hostname: string;
  contact_id: number | null;
  manufacturer: string | null;
  model: string | null;
  serial_number: string | null;
  in_service_date: string; // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  warranty_expiration_date: string | null; // ISO date
  pdq_device_id: string | null;
  screenconnect_session_id: string | null;
  status: 'active' | 'retired';
  retired_at: string | null; // ISO timestamp
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp
  updated_at: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

**AssetWithRelations Interface:**
```typescript
interface AssetWithRelations extends Asset {
  contact?: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    client_id: number;
  };
  client?: {
    id: number;
    company_name: string;
  };
}
```

Note: Backend returns snake_case field names (not camelCase). Frontend types match this format.

### Page Layout Pattern

**Existing Detail Page Pattern:**
[Source: frontend/src/pages/TicketDetailPage.tsx or similar]

- Page structure: Header section (title, breadcrumb, actions) + Info card section + Related data sections
- Header: h1 title, badge for status, action buttons (top-right)
- Info card: shadcn/ui Card with labeled fields in grid layout (2-3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
- Breadcrumb: Client Name > Contact Name (if applicable)
- Loading state: Full-page Loader2 spinner while fetching data
- Error state: "Asset not found" message with button to return to list

**Responsive Design:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Tailwind CSS]

- Mobile (<768px): Single column layout, buttons stack vertically
- Desktop (≥768px): Grid layout for info fields, buttons in row
- Use Tailwind breakpoints: `md:`, `lg:`

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `frontend/src/pages/AssetDetailPage.tsx` - Asset detail page component
- `frontend/src/components/assets/ExternalToolLinks.tsx` - ScreenConnect/PDQ button component

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Add `/assets/:id` route
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAssets.ts` - Add `useAsset(id)` hook
- `frontend/src/lib/api/assets.ts` - Add `getById(id)` function
- `frontend/src/components/assets/AssetList.tsx` - Connect View and Edit buttons to detail page and edit modal

**Existing Files (No Changes):**
- `frontend/src/components/assets/AssetForm.tsx` - Already supports edit mode
- `frontend/src/components/assets/WarrantyBadge.tsx` - Reusable component

### Performance Considerations

**Page Load Time Target:**
[Source: PRD NFR5]

- Asset detail page must load in <1 second
- Single asset query is fast (indexed by primary key)
- No performance concerns for detail page

**Navigation Performance:**
[Source: React Router patterns]

- Use React Router `<Link>` component for navigation (prefetch on hover)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (memoize components if needed)

### Testing

**Test Framework:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

# Story 2.3: Client Management API Endpoints

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** RESTful API endpoints for client CRUD operations,
**so that** the frontend can manage client data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `POST /api/clients` creates new client with domains (accepts array of domain strings)
2. `GET /api/clients` returns list of all clients with associated domains
3. `GET /api/clients/:id` returns single client with domains and contact count
4. `PUT /api/clients/:id` updates client and replaces domains list
5. `DELETE /api/clients/:id` removes client - returns 403 error if any invoice locks reference this client's tickets, otherwise cascade deletes all contacts, tickets, and time entries with confirmation dialog showing data counts
6. All endpoints require authentication (401 if not logged in)
7. Endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
8. Request validation returns clear error messages (e.g., "domain format invalid")
9. API endpoints tested manually using cURL/Postman or unit tests

{
  "companyName": "Acme Corporation",
  "xeroCustomerId": "123abc",
  "maintenanceContractType": "Monthly Retainer",
  "domains": ["acme.com", "acmecorp.com", "acme.net"]
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "id": 1,
  "companyName": "Acme Corporation",
  "xeroCustomerId": "123abc",
  "maintenanceContractType": "Monthly Retainer",
  "domains": ["acme.com", "acmecorp.com", "acme.net"],
  "contactCount": 5,
  "createdAt": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-09-30T14:00:00Z"
}
```

**5. Delete Client**
```
DELETE /api/clients/:id
Authorization: Required (session cookie)

Response: 200 OK (success)
{
  "message": "Client deleted successfully",
  "deletedCounts": {
    "contacts": 5,
    "tickets": 12,
    "timeEntries": 48
  }
}

Response: 403 Forbidden (has locked invoices)
{
  "error": "ClientHasLockedInvoices",
  "message": "Cannot delete client with locked invoices",
  "lockedMonths": ["2025-08", "2025-09"]
}
```

### Validation Rules
Using express-validator:
```javascript
body('companyName').trim().isLength({ min: 1, max: 255 })
  .withMessage('Company name is required (max 255 characters)'),
body('maintenanceContractType')
  .isIn(['Hourly', 'Monthly Retainer', 'Project-Based', 'None'])
  .withMessage('Invalid contract type'),
body('domains').isArray({ max: 50 })
  .withMessage('Domains must be an array (max 50)'),
body('domains.*').matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/)
  .withMessage('Invalid domain format')
```

### Error Response Format
All errors follow consistent structure:
```json
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Company name is required"
}
```

### Architecture Notes
**Data Transformation**: Backend uses snake_case, frontend expects camelCase
- Transformation handled in controller layer
- Example: `company_name` (DB) → `companyName` (API response)

**Transaction Handling**:
- Client creation wraps client + domain inserts in transaction
- Client update wraps update + domain replacement in transaction
- Client deletion wraps cascade deletes in transaction

### Testing
**Testing Strategy**: Manual testing using cURL or Postman

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Create client: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/clients -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"companyName":"Acme","maintenanceContractType":"Hourly","domains":["acme.com"]}'`
- [x] Get all clients: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/clients`
- [x] Get client by ID: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/clients/1`
- [x] Update client: `curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/clients/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"companyName":"Acme Corp","maintenanceContractType":"Monthly Retainer","domains":["acme.com","acme.net"]}'`
- [x] Delete client: `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/clients/1`
- [x] Test without auth: Should return 401
- [x] Test invalid data: Should return 400 with error message
- [x] Test delete locked client: Should return 403

### Improvements Checklist

**Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority):**
- [ ] **DOC-401**: Add JSDoc comments for Client model methods (similar to Contact model validation helpers)
- [ ] **REFACTOR-401**: Extract validation helpers to separate functions (e.g., `validateClientInput`, `validateDomain`) for better testability and reusability
- [ ] **CONSISTENCY-401**: Standardize domain validation regex between routes and model (both work, but inconsistent)

**Note:** All items above are optional improvements for maintainability. Current implementation is production-ready.

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Security Strengths:**
- ✅ Parameterized queries throughout (SQL injection prevention)
- ✅ Authentication middleware enforced on all routes
- ✅ Input validation with express-validator (companyName, maintenanceContractType, domains)
- ✅ Domain format validation with regex
- ✅ Transaction isolation prevents race conditions
- ✅ Domain normalization (toLowerCase) prevents case-sensitivity issues
- ✅ Duplicate domain detection (unique constraint + friendly error message)
- ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- ✅ Proper error handling without information disclosure

**Observations:**
- Model layer relies on route-level validation (acceptable pattern, similar to other stories)
- All security controls are properly implemented and tested

**Recommendation:** No security concerns. Ready for production.

### Performance Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Performance Strengths:**
- Proper indexes on foreign keys: `idx_clients_company_name`, `idx_client_domains_client_id`, `idx_client_domains_domain`
- JSON aggregation for domains (single query, no N+1 issues)
- Batch insert for domains (single parameterized query for multiple domains)
- Efficient JOIN for contact count calculation
- Search with ILIKE properly parameterized
- Transaction management doesn't hold locks unnecessarily
- Connection release in finally blocks (no connection leaks)

**Performance Characteristics:**
- All queries are O(1) or O(log n) with proper indexes
- No N+1 query patterns
- Efficient bulk operations

**Recommendation:** Performance is production-ready for expected scale (1-2 users, <100 clients per PRD).

### Reliability Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Reliability Strengths:**
- Transaction rollback on errors (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK pattern)
- Client release in finally blocks (no connection leaks)
- Proper error handling in all endpoints
- Invoice lock check prevents data integrity issues (403 if locked tickets exist)
- Cascade delete preserves referential integrity
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Proper handling of edge cases: duplicate domains, missing clients, locked invoices

**Error Handling Coverage:**
- 201: Client created successfully
- 200: Operations succeeded
- 400: Validation errors, duplicate domains
- 401: Not authenticated (handled by middleware)
- 403: Cannot delete client with locked invoices
- 404: Client not found
- 500: Server errors with rollback

**Recommendation:** Reliability is production-ready. Error handling is comprehensive.

### Maintainability Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Maintainability Strengths:**
- Repository pattern with clean separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Clear function structure and responsibilities
- Standard Express patterns (easy for new developers)
- Validation rules clearly defined and documented
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Transaction patterns are consistent

**Minor Observations:**
- Could benefit from JSDoc comments for model methods (low priority)
- Validation logic could be extracted to helpers for testability (low priority)

**Recommendation:** Code is maintainable. Optional enhancements documented above.

### Files Modified During Review

None. All improvements are optional and documented for team consideration.

### Gate Status

Gate: **✅ PASS** → [docs/qa/gates/2.3-client-api-endpoints.yml](docs/qa/gates/2.3-client-api-endpoints.yml)

- ✅ High reliability (transactions, error handling, invoice lock protection)
- ✅ Strong maintainability (repository pattern, consistent conventions, clear structure)
- ✅ Complete manual testing (all scenarios tested and documented)

The optional improvements listed above are low-priority maintainability enhancements. Current implementation is production-ready.

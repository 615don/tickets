# Story 5.4: Historical Ticket Search Implementation

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to search for past tickets by keyword, client, or date range,
**so that** I can find historical work for billing disputes or reference (FR12).

## Acceptance Criteria

2. State filter allows viewing: open tickets, recently closed (7 days), all closed tickets
3. Search executes in real-time as user types (client-side filtering)
4. Results displayed in table with columns: ticket ID, client, contact, total hours, last updated
5. Each result row clickable to navigate to ticket detail
6. Empty state message shown when no results found
7. Loading indicator shown during data fetch
8. Filter state preserved in URL query params for bookmarking/sharing
9. "Clear" button resets search keyword
10. Page accessible from main navigation ("Tickets")
11. Page loads and search executes efficiently (<1 second)

## Dev Notes

### Important Context
**This story documents the implemented ticket search functionality.** The implementation uses **client-side filtering** instead of a dedicated backend search API. This approach is simpler and sufficient for MVP with a single user and reasonable ticket volumes.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Backend: Standard `GET /api/tickets?state={open|closed}` endpoint
- Frontend: Client-side filtering using React `useMemo` hook
- Search filters: Client name, contact name, ticket ID (case-insensitive)
- State filters: Open, Recently Closed (7 days), All Closed

**Deviation from PRD:**
- Original PRD Epic 5.4 specified backend search API (`GET /api/tickets/search`)
- Implementation uses client-side filtering for simplicity
- No date range filters (can be added in future if needed)
- No pagination (all tickets loaded, filtered client-side)

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.2 implementation]
- TicketsPage created to support full ticket list viewing with state filtering
- React Query hooks established for data fetching
- SearchBar component built as reusable component
- Mobile-responsive design with table (desktop) and card (mobile) views

**VERIFIED:** The ticket search functionality exists in the codebase:
- Frontend page: `frontend/src/pages/TicketsPage.tsx`
- Search component: `frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx`
- API service: `frontend/src/lib/api/tickets.ts`
- React Query hooks: `frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts`

- `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js` - Controllers: `getAllTickets()`, `getRecentlyClosedTickets()`
- `backend/src/models/Ticket.js` - Ticket model

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**Ticket Interface (search display):**
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: number;
  clientId: number;
  clientName: string;          // Used in search
  contactId: number;
  contactName: string;          // Used in search
  description: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
  state: 'open' | 'closed';
  closedAt: string | null;
  totalHours: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;            // Displayed as "Last Updated"
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]

**Get All Tickets Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets?state={open|closed}`
- **Auth:** Required (session-based)
- **Query Params:**
  - `state` - Filter by state: `open` or `closed`
- **Response:** Array of Ticket objects with joined client/contact names

**Get Recently Closed Tickets Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets/recently-closed`
- **Auth:** Required
- **Response:** Array of Ticket objects closed within last 7 days

### Component Specifications
[Source: frontend/src/pages/TicketsPage.tsx]

**TicketsPage Component:**
Implements full ticket search and filtering functionality:

**Search Features:**
1. **Keyword Search** (lines 40, 70-75)
   - Real-time filtering as user types
   - Searches: `clientName`, `contactName`, `ticket.id`
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Client-side filtering using `useMemo` hook

2. **State Filter** (lines 44-97)
   - Dropdown with 3 options: Open, Recently Closed, All Closed
   - Changes URL query param: `?state={value}`
   - Triggers different API calls based on selection

3. **Sorting** (lines 77-80)
   - Sort by ticket ID (ascending/descending)
   - Toggle sort direction by clicking ID column header

4. **URL Preservation** (lines 89-97)
   - Filter state saved in URL: `?state=recently-closed`
   - Allows bookmarking and sharing filtered views
   - Updates on filter change

**SearchBar Component:**
[Source: frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx]
- Text input with search icon
- Clear button (X) when value present
- Real-time `onChange` handler
- Accessible and responsive

**Display Variants:**
- **Desktop:** Table with sortable columns
- **Mobile:** Card layout with key information
- **Empty States:** Context-aware messages based on filter

### Client-Side Filtering Logic
[Source: TicketsPage.tsx lines 70-83]

```typescript
const filteredTickets = useMemo(() => {
  const filtered = tickets.filter((ticket) =>
    ticket.clientName.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    ticket.contactName.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    ticket.id.toString().includes(searchQuery)
  );

  filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    const comparison = a.id - b.id;
    return sortAsc ? comparison : -comparison;
  });

  return filtered;
}, [tickets, searchQuery, sortAsc]);
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- `useMemo` hook prevents unnecessary re-filtering
- Efficient for MVP scale (single user, reasonable ticket volume)
- React Query caching reduces API calls (5-minute staleTime)

### State Filter Implementation
[Source: TicketsPage.tsx lines 56-68]

```typescript
const { data: tickets = [], isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: filterState === 'recently-closed'
    ? ticketKeys.recentlyClosed()
    : ticketKeys.list(`state=${filterState === 'open' ? 'open' : 'closed'}`),
  queryFn: () => {
    if (filterState === 'recently-closed') {
      return ticketsApi.getRecentlyClosed();
    }
    return ticketsApi.getAll({ state: filterState === 'open' ? 'open' : 'closed' });
  },
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
});
```

**Filter Options:**
1. **Open** - Shows open tickets (`state=open`)
2. **Recently Closed (7 days)** - Shows tickets closed in last 7 days
3. **All Closed Tickets** - Shows all closed tickets (`state=closed`)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.8.3
- **State Management:** React Query (TanStack Query) 5.83.0
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (Table, Select, Card, Button)
- **Routing:** React Router with URL query params
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Date Formatting:** date-fns library

### Performance & User Experience
[Source: Story AC 11, NFR3]

**Performance Goals:**
- Page loads in <1 second
- Search executes instantly (client-side)
- Efficient rendering with React keys and memoization

**Achieved:**
- ✅ React Query caching (5-minute staleTime) reduces API calls
- ✅ `useMemo` hook optimizes filtering/sorting
- ✅ Client-side filtering provides instant feedback
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile-optimized card view

### Future Enhancements (Not Required for MVP)
**Potential Additions:**
- Date range filter (filter by `createdAt` or `work_date`)
- Description/notes text search
- Backend search API for large data sets
- Pagination for >100 tickets
- Export search results to CSV
- Advanced filters: billable/non-billable, client type

**Current Limitations:**
- Client-side filtering loads all tickets (acceptable for MVP scale)
- No full-text search on description/notes
- No date range filtering
- Sorting only by ID (not by date, hours, etc.)

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Manual browser testing for MVP
- Test on desktop and mobile viewports

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **Keyword Search:**
   - Search by client name: "acme" → Shows Acme Corp tickets
   - Search by contact name: "john" → Shows John Doe tickets
   - Search by ticket ID: "42" → Shows ticket #42
   - Case insensitive: "ACME" matches "Acme Corp"
   - No results: "zzz" → Shows "No tickets match your search"

2. **State Filtering:**
   - Select "Open Tickets" → Shows only open tickets
   - Select "Recently Closed (7 days)" → Shows tickets closed within 7 days
   - Select "All Closed Tickets" → Shows all closed tickets
   - URL updates correctly for each filter

3. **Combined Search and Filter:**
   - Filter "Closed" + Search "acme" → Shows only closed Acme tickets
   - Switch filter while searching → Search persists, results update

4. **Sorting:**
   - Click ID header → Tickets sort ascending
   - Click ID header again → Tickets sort descending
   - Arrow icon indicates sort direction

5. **URL Preservation:**
   - Navigate to `/tickets?state=closed` → Shows closed tickets
   - Bookmark URL → Returns to same filtered view
   - Share URL → Recipient sees same filter

6. **Clear Search:**
   - Search "acme" → Click X button → Search clears, shows all tickets
   - X button only visible when search has value

7. **Empty States:**
   - No open tickets → "No open tickets. All work is complete!"
   - No recently closed tickets → "No tickets closed in the last 7 days."
   - No search results → "No tickets match your search."

8. **Navigation:**
   - Click ticket row → Navigates to `/tickets/:id`
   - Click "Create Ticket" button → Navigates to `/tickets/create`
   - Click "Tickets" in navbar → Navigates to `/tickets`

9. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Mobile view shows card layout instead of table
   - Search and filter dropdowns work on mobile
   - Touch interactions work correctly

10. **Performance:**
    - Page loads quickly (<1 second)
    - Search provides instant feedback (no lag)
    - Loading indicator shows during initial data fetch

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Manual testing workflow
1. npm --prefix frontend run dev
2. npm --prefix backend start
3. Login to application
4. Navigate to "Tickets" from navbar
5. Test keyword search with various inputs
6. Test all 3 state filter options
7. Test sorting by clicking ID header
8. Test URL bookmarking with different filters
9. Test mobile viewport responsiveness
10. Test with 0 tickets, 1 ticket, and many tickets
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
_Previously implemented - not tracked_

### Debug Log References
_None_

### Completion Notes List
**Implementation Summary:**
This story was implemented with a client-side filtering approach instead of the backend search API originally specified in PRD Epic 5.4 and 5.5. This simplification is appropriate for MVP with a single user and reasonable ticket volumes.

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Client-Side Filtering:** Used React `useMemo` for instant search results
2. **No Backend Search API:** Avoided complexity of dedicated search endpoint
3. **State Filtering:** Leveraged existing `GET /api/tickets?state={value}` endpoint
4. **URL Query Params:** Preserved filter state for bookmarking/sharing

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Keyword search (client, contact, ticket ID)
- ✅ State filter dropdown (open, recently closed, all closed)
- ✅ Real-time filtering as user types
- ✅ Sortable ticket ID column
- ✅ URL preservation with query params
- ✅ Empty states for all scenarios
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Loading indicators

**Future Considerations:**
- If ticket volume grows significantly (>500 tickets), consider backend search API
- Date range filtering could be added if users request it
- Full-text search on description/notes would require backend implementation

# Story 3.6: Ticket Close & Re-open Logic

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** API logic for closing and re-opening tickets with business rules,
**so that** tickets follow the 7-day re-open window requirement (FR4).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `PUT /api/tickets/:id` with `state: "closed"` sets `closed_at` timestamp to current date/time
2. `PUT /api/tickets/:id` with `state: "open"` validates re-open eligibility (within 7 days of closed_at)
3. Re-opening ticket more than 7 days after closure returns 400 error with message: "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
4. Re-opening eligible ticket clears `closed_at` timestamp
5. Closing already-closed ticket is idempotent (no error, updates closed_at)
6. API response includes re-open eligibility flag for closed tickets
7. Unit tests written and passing for edge cases (exactly 7 days, timezone handling, idempotency)

## Tasks / Subtasks

**Prerequisites:** Story 3.5 must be completed before starting this story (dependency: updateTicket controller exists)

- [x] Task 1: Implement NEW close/re-open validation logic in updateTicket controller (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Add logic to fetch existing ticket state before state transition
  - [x] Implement closing logic: call Ticket.close(id) when state changes to "closed" (handles idempotent closing)
  - [x] Implement re-opening validation: when state changes to "open" from "closed", validate 7-day window using Ticket.canReopen()
  - [x] Return 400 error with correct message when re-open validation fails
  - [x] Call Ticket.reopen(id) when re-opening is eligible
  - [x] Note: Re-opening already-open ticket requires no special handling (state update is no-op)
- [x] Task 2: Add close/re-open methods to Ticket model object (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] Add `close(id)` method to Ticket export object - sets state='closed' and closed_at=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  - [x] Add `reopen(id)` method to Ticket export object - sets state='open' and closed_at=NULL
  - [x] Add `canReopen(closedAt)` helper function to Ticket export object - returns boolean for 7-day window check
  - [x] Export all three methods from Ticket model for use in controller
- [x] Task 3: Enhance convertToCamelCase helper to include canReopen flag (AC: 6)
  - [x] Modify convertToCamelCase function in backend/src/models/Ticket.js (lines 44-61)
  - [x] Add canReopen calculation: if state='closed' and closedAt exists, call canReopen(closedAt)
  - [x] Set canReopen=null for open tickets (not applicable)
  - [x] Ensures canReopen flag included in all ticket responses (findAll, findById, update)
- [x] Task 4: Update API specification with close/re-open behavior (AC: all)
  - [x] Document state transition rules in docs/architecture/api-specification.md
  - [x] Document error responses for re-open violations
  - [x] Document canReopen flag in response schema
  - [x] Note: Can be completed after implementation to verify documented behavior matches
- [x] Task 5: Write unit tests for close/re-open logic (AC: 7)
  - [x] Create test file backend/src/models/__tests__/Ticket.test.js for model methods
  - [x] Test canReopen() edge case: exactly 7 days (should return true)
  - [x] Test canReopen() edge case: 7 days + 1 second (should return false)
  - [x] Test canReopen() with null closedAt (should return false)
  - [x] Test close() method sets state and closed_at correctly
  - [x] Test reopen() method clears closed_at and sets state to open
  - [x] Create test file backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js for controller
  - [x] Test closing open ticket (AC1)
  - [x] Test closing already-closed ticket idempotency (AC5)
  - [x] Test re-opening within 7 days succeeds (AC2, AC4)
  - [x] Test re-opening after 7 days returns 400 error (AC3)
  - [x] Test canReopen flag in API responses (AC6)
- [x] Task 6: Manual validation testing (optional verification)
  - [x] Test closing open ticket via cURL (sets closed_at)
  - [x] Test closing already-closed ticket via cURL (idempotent)
  - [x] Test re-opening within 7 days via cURL (succeeds, clears closed_at)
  - [x] Test re-opening after 7 days via cURL (fails with 400)
  - [x] Test re-opening at exactly 7 days boundary via cURL
  - [x] Test canReopen flag in API responses via cURL

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 3.5 - Ticket Update & Time Entry Management API]
- `updateTicket` controller already exists in `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js`
- Controller validates state field and accepts "open" or "closed" values
- `Ticket.update(id, fields)` method available for updating ticket fields
- Current implementation does NOT handle `closed_at` timestamp logic
- Error handling pattern established (404 for not found, 400 for validation)

### Relevant Source Tree

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js` - **MODIFY** - Enhance updateTicket with close/re-open logic
- `backend/src/models/Ticket.js` - **MODIFY** - Add close(), reopen(), canReopen() methods
- `backend/src/routes/tickets.js` - Existing PUT /:id route already in place
- `docs/architecture/api-specification.md` - **UPDATE** - Document close/re-open behavior

### Data Model: Ticket

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#ticket]

**Relevant Fields for Close/Re-open**:
- `state`: enum ('open' | 'closed') - Current ticket state
- `closedAt`: Date | null - Timestamp when ticket was closed, null when open
- `updatedAt`: Date - Last modification timestamp (automatically updated)

**State Transition Rules**:
- Open → Closed: Set `state = 'closed'`, set `closedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- Closed → Open: Validate `closedAt` within 7 days, set `state = 'open'`, set `closedAt = NULL`
- Closed → Closed: Idempotent, update `closedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

### Database Schema: tickets Table

[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

**Relevant Columns**:
- `state` VARCHAR - Enum constraint ('open', 'closed')
- `closed_at` TIMESTAMP NULL - Timestamp when closed, null when open
- `updated_at` TIMESTAMP - Automatically updated by database

**No Migration Required**: Schema already supports close/re-open logic

### API Specification: PUT /api/tickets/:id

[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#tickets]

**Existing Endpoint**: `PUT /api/tickets/:id` - Update ticket

**Request Body** (current):
```json
{
  "description": "Updated description",
  "notes": "Updated notes",
  "state": "open"
}
```

**Success Response** (current - 200 OK):
```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "clientId": 1,
  "contactId": 5,
  "description": "Updated description",
  "notes": "Updated notes",
  "state": "open",
  "closedAt": null,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-01T14:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-01T18:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**New Enhancement Required**:
- Add `canReopen` boolean flag to response (computed field)
- `canReopen = true` if ticket is closed AND `closedAt` is within 7 days of current time
- `canReopen = false` if ticket is closed AND `closedAt` is more than 7 days ago
- `canReopen = null` if ticket is open (not applicable)

**New Error Response** (400 Bad Request - Re-open Violation):
```json
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
}
```

### Close/Re-open Logic Implementation

[Source: FR4 from PRD]

**Business Rules**:
1. **7-Day Window**: Tickets can only be re-opened within 7 days of closure
2. **Idempotent Closing**: Closing an already-closed ticket updates `closed_at` without error
3. **Timestamp Handling**: Use database `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for consistency, avoid client timestamps
4. **Eligibility Calculation**: `canReopen = (NOW() - closedAt) <= 7 days`

**Controller Logic Pattern** (enhance existing updateTicket):
```javascript
// backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js
export const updateTicket = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const { description, notes, state } = req.body;

    // ... existing validation ...

    // If state is changing, apply close/re-open logic
    if (state !== undefined) {
      // Get existing ticket to check current state
      const existingTicket = await Ticket.findById(id);

      if (state === 'closed') {
        // Closing: Set closed_at timestamp (idempotent)
        await Ticket.close(id);
      } else if (state === 'open') {
        // Re-opening: Validate 7-day window
        if (existingTicket.state === 'closed') {
          const canReopen = Ticket.canReopen(existingTicket.closedAt);
          if (!canReopen) {
            return res.status(400).json({
              error: 'ValidationError',
              message: 'Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago'
            });
          }
          await Ticket.reopen(id);
        }
      }
    }

    // ... existing update logic for description/notes ...

    const ticket = await Ticket.findById(id);
    res.status(200).json(ticket);
  } catch (error) {
    // ... existing error handling ...
  }
};
```

**Model Methods** (add to Ticket export object in [backend/src/models/Ticket.js](backend/src/models/Ticket.js)):

```javascript
// backend/src/models/Ticket.js

export const Ticket = {
  // ... existing methods (create, findAll, findById, update, delete, touch) ...

  /**
   * Close a ticket by setting state and closed_at timestamp
   * Idempotent - can be called on already-closed tickets
   * @param {number} id - Ticket ID
   * @returns {Promise<Ticket>} - Updated ticket
   */
  async close(id) {
    const result = await query(
      `UPDATE tickets
       SET
         state = 'closed',
         closed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
       WHERE id = $1
       RETURNING id`,
      [id]
    );

    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('Ticket not found');
    }

    return await this.findById(id);
  },

  /**
   * Re-open a ticket by clearing closed_at and setting state to open
   * @param {number} id - Ticket ID
   * @returns {Promise<Ticket>} - Updated ticket
   */
  async reopen(id) {
    const result = await query(
      `UPDATE tickets
       SET
         state = 'open',
         closed_at = NULL,
         updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
       WHERE id = $1
       RETURNING id`,
      [id]
    );

    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('Ticket not found');
    }

    return await this.findById(id);
  },

  /**
   * Check if a closed ticket can be re-opened (within 7 days)
   * @param {Date|string} closedAt - Timestamp when ticket was closed
   * @returns {boolean} - True if can reopen, false otherwise
   */
  canReopen(closedAt) {
    if (!closedAt) return false;

    const closedDate = new Date(closedAt);
    const now = new Date();
    const daysSinceClosed = (now - closedDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);

    return daysSinceClosed <= 7;
  }
};
```

**IMPORTANT:** These methods must be added to the existing `Ticket` export object (not as standalone functions). They will be called as `Ticket.close(id)`, `Ticket.reopen(id)`, and `Ticket.canReopen(closedAt)` from the controller.

**Response Enhancement** (add canReopen flag):

Update `convertToCamelCase` helper in [backend/src/models/Ticket.js:44-61](backend/src/models/Ticket.js#L44-L61) to include canReopen calculation:

```javascript
function convertToCamelCase(row) {
  if (!row) return null;

  const ticket = {
    id: row.id,
    clientId: row.client_id,
    clientName: row.client_name,
    contactId: row.contact_id,
    contactName: row.contact_name,
    description: row.description,
    notes: row.notes,
    state: row.state,
    closedAt: row.closed_at,
    totalHours: row.total_hours ? parseFloat(row.total_hours) : null,
    createdAt: row.created_at,
    updatedAt: row.updated_at
  };

  // Add canReopen flag for closed tickets
  if (ticket.state === 'closed' && ticket.closedAt) {
    ticket.canReopen = Ticket.canReopen(ticket.closedAt);
  } else {
    ticket.canReopen = null; // Not applicable for open tickets
  }

  return ticket;
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** The `convertToCamelCase` function is called by `findAll()`, `findById()`, and `update()`, so adding canReopen here ensures it's included in all ticket responses.

### Timezone Handling

[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

**Critical**: Use PostgreSQL `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for all timestamp operations to ensure consistency

**Rationale**:
- Database timestamps stored in UTC
- Avoids client timezone issues
- 7-day calculation performed server-side using consistent timestamps

**Date Math**:
- `(NOW() - closedAt)` yields interval in milliseconds
- Convert to days: `milliseconds / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)`
- Compare against 7 days threshold

### Edge Cases & Testing Considerations

[Source: AC7 - Logic unit tested for edge cases]

**Edge Case 1: Exactly 7 Days**
- Ticket closed at `2025-10-01 10:00:00`
- Current time `2025-10-08 10:00:00` (exactly 168 hours)
- Expected: `canReopen = true` (7.0 days ≤ 7)

**Edge Case 2: 7 Days + 1 Second**
- Ticket closed at `2025-10-01 10:00:00`
- Current time `2025-10-08 10:00:01` (168 hours + 1 sec)
- Expected: `canReopen = false` (7.0000116 days > 7)

**Edge Case 3: Re-opening Open Ticket**
- Ticket already has `state = 'open'`
- PUT with `state: "open"` should be idempotent (no error)
- `closedAt` already null, no validation needed

**Edge Case 4: Closing Closed Ticket (AC5)**
- Ticket already has `state = 'closed'`
- PUT with `state: "closed"` updates `closed_at` to current time (idempotent)

**Testing Checklist** (covered by unit tests in Task 5):
- [ ] Close open ticket → verify `closed_at` set and `state = 'closed'`
- [ ] Close already-closed ticket → verify `closed_at` updated, no error
- [ ] Re-open ticket within 7 days → verify `closed_at = null` and `state = 'open'`
- [ ] Re-open ticket after 7 days → verify 400 error with correct message
- [ ] Re-open ticket at exactly 7 days boundary → verify succeeds
- [ ] GET ticket response includes `canReopen` flag correctly
- [ ] Re-open already-open ticket → verify idempotent (no error)

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests required for AC7, with optional manual validation via cURL

**Unit Test Framework**: Node.js native test runner (`node:test`) with `node:assert`

**Test File Locations**:
- Model tests: `backend/src/models/__tests__/Ticket.test.js`
- Controller tests: `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js`

**Model Unit Tests** (Ticket.canReopen edge cases):

```javascript
// backend/src/models/__tests__/Ticket.test.js
import { describe, it } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { Ticket } from '../Ticket.js';

describe('Ticket.canReopen()', () => {
  it('should return true for ticket closed exactly 7 days ago', () => {
    const closedAt = new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Exactly 7 days
    assert.strictEqual(Ticket.canReopen(closedAt), true);
  });

  it('should return false for ticket closed 7 days + 1 second ago', () => {
    const closedAt = new Date(Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 1000)); // 7 days + 1 sec
    assert.strictEqual(Ticket.canReopen(closedAt), false);
  });

  it('should return false when closedAt is null', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(Ticket.canReopen(null), false);
  });

  it('should return true for ticket closed 3 days ago', () => {
    const closedAt = new Date(Date.now() - 3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    assert.strictEqual(Ticket.canReopen(closedAt), true);
  });

  it('should return false for ticket closed 30 days ago', () => {
    const closedAt = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    assert.strictEqual(Ticket.canReopen(closedAt), false);
  });
});

describe('Ticket.close() - integration', () => {
  // NOTE: Requires database setup/teardown
  // Test: Create open ticket, call close(), verify state='closed' and closed_at is set
});

describe('Ticket.reopen() - integration', () => {
  // NOTE: Requires database setup/teardown
  // Test: Create closed ticket, call reopen(), verify state='open' and closed_at is null
});
```

**Controller Unit Tests** (close/re-open API behavior):

```javascript
// backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js
import { describe, it, before, after } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import request from 'supertest'; // or similar HTTP testing library

describe('PUT /api/tickets/:id - Close ticket', () => {
  it('should set closed_at when closing open ticket (AC1)', async () => {
    // Create open ticket, send PUT with state: "closed"
    // Verify response includes closedAt timestamp and state='closed'
  });

  it('should be idempotent when closing already-closed ticket (AC5)', async () => {
    // Create closed ticket, send PUT with state: "closed" again
    // Verify no error, closed_at updated to new timestamp
  });
});

describe('PUT /api/tickets/:id - Re-open ticket', () => {
  it('should validate 7-day window and succeed within 7 days (AC2, AC4)', async () => {
    // Create ticket closed within 7 days
    // Send PUT with state: "open"
    // Verify 200 OK, closedAt=null, state='open'
  });

  it('should return 400 error when re-opening after 7 days (AC3)', async () => {
    // Create ticket closed 8 days ago (via direct DB manipulation)
    // Send PUT with state: "open"
    // Verify 400 error with message "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
  });

  it('should include canReopen flag in ticket responses (AC6)', async () => {
    // GET ticket that is closed within 7 days → verify canReopen=true
    // GET ticket that is closed after 7 days → verify canReopen=false
    // GET ticket that is open → verify canReopen=null
  });
});
```

**Running Tests**:
```bash
# Run all tests (add to package.json scripts)
npm test

# Run specific test file
node --test backend/src/models/__tests__/Ticket.test.js
node --test backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js
```

**package.json update needed**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node --test backend/src/**/__tests__/*.test.js"
  }
}
```

**Manual Validation Testing** (optional - primarily for Task 6):

```bash
# Get session cookie first
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -c /tmp/cookies.txt \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'

# Close a ticket
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/tickets/42 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=<session_cookie>" \
  -d '{"state": "closed"}'

# Expected Response (200 OK):
# {
#   "id": 42,
#   "state": "closed",
#   "closedAt": "2025-10-01T18:30:00.000Z",
#   "canReopen": true,
#   ...
# }

# Re-open ticket within 7 days
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/tickets/42 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=<session_cookie>" \
  -d '{"state": "open"}'

# Expected Response (200 OK):
# {
#   "id": 42,
#   "state": "open",
#   "closedAt": null,
#   "canReopen": null,
#   ...
# }

# Test re-open after 7 days (manually adjust closed_at in DB first)
# UPDATE tickets SET closed_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '8 days' WHERE id = 42;

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/tickets/42 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=<session_cookie>" \
  -d '{"state": "open"}'

# Expected Response (400 Bad Request):
# {
#   "error": "ValidationError",
#   "message": "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
# }

# Verify canReopen flag
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/tickets/42 \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=<session_cookie>"

# Expected Response includes:
# - "canReopen": true (if within 7 days)
# - "canReopen": false (if after 7 days)
# - "canReopen": null (if open)
```

**Database Queries for Manual Edge Case Testing**:
```sql
-- Set closed_at to exactly 7 days ago
UPDATE tickets
SET closed_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
WHERE id = 42;

-- Set closed_at to 7 days + 1 second ago
UPDATE tickets
SET closed_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days 1 second'
WHERE id = 42;
```

**Note:** Direct SQL modification is acceptable for manual validation testing but unit tests should not rely on this approach.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Excellent**

The implementation demonstrates strong technical execution with comprehensive test coverage and clean architecture. The close/reopen business logic is correctly implemented with proper validation, idempotent operations, and excellent edge case handling. Code is well-documented with clear JSDoc comments.

**Strengths:**
- Complete requirements coverage - all 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented
- Excellent test architecture with 8 unit tests covering edge cases (7-day boundary, null handling, etc.)
- Clean separation of concerns - model methods handle data, controller handles validation/orchestration
- Proper use of database timestamps (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) for consistency
- Idempotent close operation correctly implemented
- canReopen computed field elegantly integrated via convertToCamelCase helper

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: [backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js](backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js#L183-L191)
  - **Change**: Moved ticket existence check outside state conditional
  - **Why**: Eliminates duplicate database query and improves error response consistency
  - **How**: All requests now perform single upfront existence check, reducing database load and ensuring consistent 404 handling regardless of whether state is being updated

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Fully compliant
  - JSDoc comments on all new methods
  - Consistent error handling patterns
  - Proper naming conventions (camelCase for functions, snake_case for database)
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Fully compliant
  - Tests in correct `__tests__` directories
  - Model and controller separation maintained
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Fully compliant
  - Unit tests using Node.js test runner (node:test)
  - Integration tests created (require database for execution)
  - Comprehensive edge case coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Complete (7/7)

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Closing sets closed_at timestamp**
- **Given**: An open ticket exists
- **When**: PUT /api/tickets/:id with state: "closed"
- **Then**: Response includes closedAt timestamp and state="closed"
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:39-61](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L39-L61)

**AC2: Re-opening validates 7-day eligibility**
- **Given**: A ticket closed within 7 days
- **When**: PUT /api/tickets/:id with state: "open"
- **Then**: Validation passes and ticket reopens
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:92-114](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L92-L114)

**AC3: Re-opening after 7 days returns 400 error**
- **Given**: A ticket closed more than 7 days ago
- **When**: PUT /api/tickets/:id with state: "open"
- **Then**: Returns 400 with message "Cannot re-open tickets closed more than 7 days ago"
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:116-139](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L116-L139)

**AC4: Re-opening clears closed_at**
- **Given**: A ticket closed within 7 days
- **When**: Successful reopen operation
- **Then**: closedAt is set to null
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:92-114](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L92-L114)

**AC5: Closing is idempotent**
- **Given**: A ticket already in closed state
- **When**: PUT /api/tickets/:id with state: "closed" again
- **Then**: No error, closed_at updated to current timestamp
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:63-88](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L63-L88)

**AC6: API response includes canReopen flag**
- **Given**: Any ticket retrieval operation
- **When**: Ticket is returned in response
- **Then**: canReopen=true (if closed <7 days), false (if closed >7 days), null (if open)
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [ticketController.test.js:172-261](backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js#L172-L261)

**AC7: Unit tests for edge cases**
- **Given**: Critical edge cases require validation
- **When**: Tests execute
- **Then**: All edge cases pass (exactly 7 days, 7 days + 1 sec, null handling, timezone consistency)
- **Test Coverage**: ✓ [Ticket.test.js:5-43](backend/src/models/__tests__/Ticket.test.js#L5-L43) - 8/8 passing

**Coverage Gaps**: None identified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored controller to eliminate duplicate findById call ([ticketController.js:183-191](backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js#L183-L191))
- [x] Verified all unit tests passing (8/8 model tests)
- [x] Confirmed edge case handling at 7-day boundary
- [x] Validated error message matches specification exactly
- [x] Verified canReopen flag integration in all response paths

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

- State transitions properly validated before database updates
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities (parameterized queries used throughout)
- Business rule enforcement (7-day window) prevents unauthorized state changes
- Idempotent operations prevent race condition issues
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

**Concerns**: None

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

- **Optimization Applied**: Reduced redundant database queries by moving existence check outside conditional (saves 1 query per request with state updates)
- Date calculation in canReopen() is O(1) JavaScript math operation
- Database uses indexed CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for consistent timestamp operations
- No N+1 query issues
- Computed canReopen field calculated efficiently in convertToCamelCase helper

**Concerns**: None

### Testability Assessment

**Controllability**: ✓ Excellent
- Clear model methods (close, reopen, canReopen) enable precise state control
- Integration tests can manipulate closed_at timestamp via direct SQL for edge case testing

**Observability**: ✓ Excellent
- canReopen flag provides clear visibility into eligibility status
- All state transitions return full ticket object
- Detailed error messages for validation failures

**Debuggability**: ✓ Excellent
- Clear separation between model and controller logic
- JSDoc comments explain method behavior
- Edge case tests document expected behavior at boundaries

**so that** I can validate the entire development-to-deployment pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React component created displaying "Hello from Outlook Add-in" in sidebar
2. Office.js initialization code implemented: `Office.onReady()` callback
3. Add-in detects Outlook host and displays host information (Outlook Web, version)
4. Sidebar renders successfully when add-in loaded in Outlook Web
5. Add-in sideloaded successfully in Outlook Web Access using manifest file
6. Task pane opens and displays hello world UI
7. Verified task pane persists when navigating between emails (or documented reload behavior)
8. No console errors or Office.js API errors during load
9. Screenshot captured of working add-in in Outlook Web for documentation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.3 (Add-in Project Setup):** Vite dev server already configured to run at `https://localhost:5173` with self-signed SSL certificate. Office.js CDN script already added to HTML template (`<script src="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js"></script>`). Project structure includes React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.8.3, Tailwind CSS 3.4.17. Sidebar layout component already exists at `/outlook-addin/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`. [Source: [1.3.add-in-project-setup-development-environment.story.md#dev-agent-record](1.3.add-in-project-setup-development-environment.story.md#dev-agent-record)]

**Story 1.4 (Manifest Creation):** Development manifest created at `/outlook-addin/manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.xml` with UUID `a5598e8c-d985-4ada-aced-2912195945a2`, requesting ReadItem permission (Mail.Read equivalent). Task pane source URL points to `https://localhost:5173`. Manifest validates successfully with Office Add-in Validator. Sideloading instructions documented in README.md. [Source: [1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#dev-agent-record](1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#dev-agent-record)]

### Office.js Integration Requirements

**Office.js Initialization Pattern:** All Office.js API calls MUST be wrapped in `Office.onReady()` callback. Office.js initialization is asynchronous and must complete before accessing Office APIs. Standard initialization pattern:

```typescript
Office.onReady((info) => {
  if (info.host === Office.HostType.Outlook) {
    // Office.js ready, safe to use Office APIs
    const hostName = Office.context.mailbox.diagnostics.hostName;
    const hostVersion = Office.context.mailbox.diagnostics.hostVersion;
  }
});
```

**Error Handling Requirement:** Office.js integration MUST fail gracefully. If Office.js fails to load or initialize, show error message but do NOT crash the add-in. Display manual mode fallback UI. [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#enhancement-specific-standards](../architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#enhancement-specific-standards)]

**Host Detection:** Use `Office.context.mailbox.diagnostics.hostName` to detect Outlook Web (returns "OutlookWebApp"). Use `hostVersion` to get version number. Store in React state for display. [Source: Office.js Mail API documentation]

**Permission Verification:** Use `Office.context.mailbox.permissions` to verify ReadItem permission granted. This confirms manifest permission request succeeded. [Source: Office.js Mailbox API documentation]

### Component Architecture Context

**Existing Sidebar Component:** Sidebar layout component already exists at `/outlook-addin/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`. This component provides scrollable container with Tailwind CSS styling. HelloWorld component should be wrapped in Sidebar for consistent layout. [Source: [component-architecture.md#new-components](../architecture/component-architecture.md#new-components)]

**Component File Location:** Create new HelloWorld component at `/outlook-addin/src/components/HelloWorld.tsx` following PascalCase naming convention. [Source: [source-tree-organization.md#integration-guidelines](../architecture/source-tree-organization.md#integration-guidelines)]

**Styling Standards:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling, consistent with existing mockup components. Apply card/container styling (e.g., `bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-4`) for visual consistency. [Source: [component-architecture.md](../architecture/component-architecture.md)]

### Technology Stack Context

**React Version:** React 18.3.1 (functional components with hooks). Use `useState` for Office.js initialization state management. Use `useEffect` to trigger Office.onReady() on component mount. [Source: [tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack](../architecture/tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack)]

**TypeScript Version:** TypeScript 5.8.3 with strict mode enabled. Use `@types/office-js` for Office.js type definitions. No `any` types without justification. [Source: [tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack](../architecture/tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack)]

**Office.js Loading:** Office.js loaded from Microsoft CDN (`https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js`). Script already included in HTML template from Story 1.3. No npm installation needed for Office.js runtime (types only). [Source: [tech-stack.md#new-technology-additions](../architecture/tech-stack.md#new-technology-additions)]

### Development Environment Context

**Dev Server Configuration:** Vite dev server runs at `https://localhost:5173` with self-signed SSL certificate. HTTPS required for Office Add-ins (security requirement). Browser will show certificate warning for localhost - this is expected and must be accepted to proceed. [Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]

**Manifest Configuration:** Development manifest points to `https://localhost:5173`. This URL must match dev server exactly. If dev server runs on different port, manifest must be updated. [Source: Story 1.4 completion notes]

**CORS Configuration:** Backend CORS already configured to allow `http://localhost:5173` in development. No CORS errors expected during local development. [Source: [security-integration.md#cors-configuration-update](../architecture/security-integration.md#cors-configuration-update)]

### Sideloading Context

**Sideloading Process:** Documented in Story 1.4. Steps: Open Outlook Web → Get Add-ins → My add-ins → Add from file → Upload manifest XML. Add-in icon should appear in Outlook toolbar. [Source: [1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#task-5](1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#task-5)]

**Manifest Requirements:** Manifest must validate against Office Add-in XML Schema 1.1. Development manifest already validates successfully (Story 1.4 verification). [Source: [1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#qa-results](1.4.office-addin-manifest-creation.story.md#qa-results)]

**Office 365 Account Requirement:** Sideloading requires valid Office 365 account with Outlook Web access. Developer must have Office 365 account to test. [Source: Story 1.4 documentation]

### Task Pane Behavior

**Task Pane Persistence:** Task pane behavior when navigating between emails depends on Office.js context mode. This story must document actual observed behavior (persists state vs. reloads component). No specific expectation defined in PRD - observation required. [Source: Epic 1 AC #7]

**Task Pane Sizing:** Task pane width controlled by Outlook Web (not add-in code). Add-in should be responsive and adapt to task pane width. Sidebar component already implements responsive layout. [Source: [component-architecture.md#sidebar](../architecture/component-architecture.md#sidebar)]

### Security Context

**HTTPS Requirement:** Office Add-ins MUST be served over HTTPS, even in development. Self-signed certificate acceptable for localhost. Browser will show security warning - this is expected behavior. [Source: [security-integration.md#enhancement-security-requirements](../architecture/security-integration.md#enhancement-security-requirements)]

**Content Security Policy:** Backend CSP already configured to allow Office.js CDN script (`https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com`). No CSP errors expected. [Source: [security-integration.md#csp-adjustments-for-officejs](../architecture/security-integration.md#csp-adjustments-for-officejs)]

**Permission Scope:** Manifest requests ReadItem permission (Mail.Read equivalent). This grants read-only access to email metadata. HelloWorld component can verify permission granted via `Office.context.mailbox.permissions`. [Source: Story 1.4 manifest configuration]

### Project Structure Alignment

**Component Directory:** Create HelloWorld.tsx in `/outlook-addin/src/components/` directory (already exists from Story 1.3). [Source: [source-tree-organization.md#new-file-organization](../architecture/source-tree-organization.md#new-file-organization)]

**Documentation Directory:** Create `/outlook-addin/docs/screenshots/` directory for screenshot storage (may not exist yet). [Source: Project structure conventions]

**README Location:** Update existing `/outlook-addin/README.md` with Hello World verification section. README already contains sideloading instructions from Story 1.4. [Source: Story 1.4 completion notes]

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual testing only for this story. No automated tests required for Hello World validation. Focus on visual verification and console error checking. [Source: [testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui](../architecture/testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui)]

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
1. **Office.js Initialization:**
   - Verify Office.onReady() callback fires successfully
   - Verify Office.context.mailbox accessible
   - Verify host detection returns "OutlookWebApp"
   - Verify hostVersion returns non-empty string

2. **Component Rendering:**
   - Verify HelloWorld component displays "Hello from Outlook Add-in"
   - Verify host information displays correctly
   - Verify Tailwind CSS styling applied (card appearance)
   - Verify Sidebar layout wraps component correctly

3. **Sideloading Verification:**
   - Verify manifest uploads successfully in Outlook Web
   - Verify add-in icon appears in toolbar
   - Verify task pane opens when icon clicked
   - Verify task pane displays HelloWorld component

4. **Console Error Check:**
   - Verify zero JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Verify zero Office.js API errors
   - Verify all network requests succeed (200 status)
   - Verify no CORS errors

5. **Task Pane Persistence:**
   - Select email in inbox, verify task pane visible
   - Navigate to different email, document task pane behavior
   - Test with no email selected, verify task pane still renders

6. **Screenshot Capture:**
   - Capture screenshot showing working add-in in Outlook Web
   - Verify screenshot includes email list, task pane, HelloWorld content
   - Save to docs/screenshots/ directory

[Source: [testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui](../architecture/testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui)]

**No Unit Tests Required:** This story implements Office.js integration and visual components. Manual testing appropriate for validation. Automated tests not justified for Hello World proof-of-concept. [Source: [testing-strategy.md#no-automated-e2e-tests-for-mvp](../architecture/testing-strategy.md#no-automated-e2e-tests-for-mvp)]

### Integration with Existing Standards

**TypeScript Standards:** Use strict TypeScript with no `any` types. Import Office.js types from `@types/office-js` package. Define interfaces for Office.js state management (initialization status, host info). [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#typescript-standards](../architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#typescript-standards)]

**React Patterns:** Use functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect). No class components. Follow existing mockup component patterns (React 18.3.1 conventions). [Source: [tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack](../architecture/tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack)]

**Error Handling:** Office.js errors must fail gracefully (show error message, never crash). Network errors not applicable to this story (no API calls). [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#error-handling](../architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#error-handling)]

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required. Implementation completed without blocking issues.

### Completion Notes List

1. **Office.js Initialization**: Implemented comprehensive Office.js initialization in App.tsx with three states (loading, ready, error). Added proper error handling and graceful degradation if Office.js fails to load.

2. **HelloWorld Component**: Created HelloWorld component displaying "Hello from Outlook Add-in" with Office.js host information. Component shows host name (mapped "OutlookWebApp" to "Outlook Web"), host version, and permission status with visual card styling using Tailwind CSS.

3. **State Management**: Implemented React hooks (useState, useEffect) for Office initialization lifecycle. HostInfo interface captures diagnostics and permissions data.

4. **Loading & Error States**: Loading state shows animated spinner during initialization. Error state displays user-friendly error message with troubleshooting guidance.

5. **Dev Server Verification**: Confirmed Vite dev server runs at https://localhost:5173 with self-signed SSL certificates. Verified Office.js CDN script loads in index.html.

6. **Manifest Validation**: Validated manifest successfully using office-addin-manifest validator. All checks passed including HTTPS requirements and schema compliance.

7. **README Documentation**: Added comprehensive "Hello World Verification" section with step-by-step verification instructions, troubleshooting guide, and screenshot reference. Documented expected behavior for task pane persistence and Office.js initialization.

8. **Manual Testing Required**: Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 9 require manual interaction with Outlook Web Access (sideloading, task pane testing, screenshot capture). These tasks are ready for human verification.

9. **TypeScript Compliance**: All code passes TypeScript strict mode compilation with no errors. Office.js types properly imported from @types/office-js package.

10. **Task Pane Persistence Behavior** (Manual Testing Results):
    - **Email Navigation**: Task pane closes completely when user switches to a different email. User must click "Create Ticket" button again to reopen. This is standard Outlook Web behavior for task pane add-ins.
    - **No Email Selected**: When no email is selected (e.g., folder view), the add-in button is greyed out and task pane cannot be opened. This is correct behavior per manifest configuration (ItemType="Message" requires message context).
    - **Console Errors Analysis**: Zero errors from add-in code. Console shows expected 404s for placeholder icons (via.placeholder.com) and unrelated Outlook Web internal errors (Azure monitor CSP violations, user photo 404s). All add-in resources load successfully.
    - **Network Tab**: All add-in resources (localhost:5173, Office.js CDN) load with 200 status. Placeholder icon 404s are expected and will be resolved when production icons are added.
    - **Responsive Behavior**: Task pane width is controlled by Outlook Web. HelloWorld component renders responsively within available space.

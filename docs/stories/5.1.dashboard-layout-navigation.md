## Dev Notes

### Important Context
**This story has been marked by the user as "already implemented during earlier development steps."** The Dev Agent's primary responsibility is to VERIFY that all acceptance criteria are met, document any gaps, and ensure the implementation matches the story requirements. If any AC is not met, implement the missing functionality.

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 4.8 completion notes]
- Dashboard and navigation components were built incrementally during Epics 1-4
- React Query hooks established pattern for data fetching with 5-minute staleTime
- Mobile-first responsive design implemented using Tailwind breakpoints
- shadcn/ui components used consistently for UI primitives
- Session-based authentication with protected routes already working

### Relevant Source Tree
**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Dashboard page component (root route `/`)
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component with stats and ticket lists
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Primary navigation header with desktop/mobile support
- `frontend/src/components/MobileMenu.tsx` - Mobile hamburger menu overlay
- `frontend/src/components/QuickStatsCard.tsx` - Stats display cards
- `frontend/src/components/TicketRow.tsx` - Ticket list row component
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTickets.ts` - React Query hooks for tickets and stats
- `frontend/src/lib/api/tickets.ts` - Tickets API service with `getStats()` method
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Routing configuration

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/routes/tickets.js` - Ticket routes including `GET /api/tickets/stats`
- `backend/src/controllers/ticketController.js` - Controller with `getDashboardStats()` function
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Authentication middleware (`requireAuth`)

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**DashboardStats Interface** (Frontend):
```typescript
interface DashboardStats {
  currentMonthHours: number;
  openTicketCount: number;
  recentlyClosedCount: number;
  lastInvoiceDate: string;
  lastInvoicedMonth: string;
}
```

**DashboardStatsResponse** (Backend):
```typescript
{
  currentMonthHours: number;      // Sum of billable hours for current month
  lastInvoiceDate: string;        // ISO date of last invoice lock
  lastInvoicedMonth: string;      // Formatted month string (e.g., "October 2025")
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]

**Dashboard Stats Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets/stats`
- **Auth:** Required (session-based)
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "currentMonthHours": 92.5,
    "lastInvoiceDate": "2025-09-30T18:00:00.000Z",
    "lastInvoicedMonth": "September 2025"
  }
  ```

**Recently Closed Tickets Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets/recently-closed`
- **Auth:** Required
- **Response:** Array of Ticket objects closed within last 7 days

**Open Tickets Endpoint:**
- **GET** `/api/tickets?state=open`
- **Auth:** Required
- **Response:** Array of Ticket objects with state='open'

### Component Specifications
[Source: Existing implementation files]

**Dashboard Component Props:**
```typescript
interface DashboardProps {
  stats: DashboardStats;
  openTickets: Ticket[];
  recentlyClosedTickets: Ticket[];
  onCreateTicket: () => void;
  onReviewInvoices: () => void;
  onTicketClick: (id: number) => void;
  onReopenTicket: (id: number) => void;
}
```

**Navbar Component:**
- Fixed position at top of viewport
- Desktop: Horizontal nav with icons and labels
- Mobile: Hamburger menu button opens MobileMenu overlay
- Active route highlighting using `useLocation()` hook
- Logout button in header

**Navigation Items:**
1. Dashboard (/)
2. Open Tickets (/tickets)
3. Create Ticket (/tickets/create)
4. Clients (/clients)
5. Contacts (/contacts)
6. Invoices (/invoices)
7. Settings (/settings)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.8.3
- **State Management:** React Query (TanStack Query) 5.83.0
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS)
- **Routing:** React Router (client-side routing)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **API Calls:** Use service layer in `frontend/src/lib/api/` (never direct fetch in components)
- **Naming:** Components use PascalCase, hooks use camelCase with 'use' prefix

### Performance Considerations
[Source: docs/prd/epic-5-views-search-historical-access.md (AC 8, NFR2)]
- Dashboard must load in <2 seconds
- Use React Query staleTime (5 minutes) to minimize API calls
- Consider implementing loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Optimize ticket list rendering (currently limits to 20 open tickets, 10 closed)

### Mobile Responsiveness Requirements
[Source: Story 5.1 AC 6]
- Mobile breakpoint: < 768px (Tailwind `md:` breakpoint)
- Hamburger menu for navigation on mobile
- Stats cards should stack vertically on mobile
- Ticket tables convert to card layout on mobile
- Quick actions sticky at bottom on mobile
- Test viewports: 320px (small mobile), 375px (iPhone), 768px (tablet)

### Visual Indicator Logic
[Source: Story 5.1 AC 4, Dashboard.tsx implementation]
Hours indicator color coding:
- **Green (success):** 85-100 hours (within expected range)
- **Yellow (warning):** <85 hours (below target)
- **Red (error):** >100 hours (over target)

Applied to QuickStatsCard "Current Month Hours" display.

### Authentication Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- Session-based auth via HTTP-only cookies (`connect.sid`)
- All `/api/*` endpoints require authentication (except `/api/auth/*`, `/api/health`)
- Protected routes implemented in React Router
- Redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **MVP Approach:** Manual testing and user acceptance testing
- **Frontend:** Manual browser testing (automated tests with Vitest planned for future)
- **Backend:** Node.js native test runner for API endpoints
- **E2E:** Manual workflow testing (Playwright planned for future)

**Test File Locations:**
- Backend tests: `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js`
- Frontend tests: Not currently required (manual testing sufficient for MVP)

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
1. **Manual Browser Testing:**
   - Test in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
   - Test responsive design at 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px
   - Verify navigation works correctly
   - Verify stats calculate correctly
   - Test quick actions trigger correct routes

2. **Backend API Testing:**
   - Verify `/api/tickets/stats` returns correct data
   - Test authentication requirement (401 if not authenticated)
   - Verify hours calculation matches expected business logic
   - Test edge cases: no invoices, no time entries, no tickets

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Full workflow: Login → Dashboard → Create Ticket → Return to Dashboard → Verify ticket appears
   - Test reopen ticket functionality from Recently Closed section
   - Verify stats update after creating/closing tickets
   - Test navigation to all linked pages and back

4. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter keys)
   - Screen reader testing (VoiceOver/NVDA)
   - Color contrast verification (WCAG AA)
   - Focus indicators visible

**Running Backend Tests:**
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings" node --test backend/src/controllers/__tests__/ticketController.test.js
```

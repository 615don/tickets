# Story 1.2: Database Setup & Connection

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a PostgreSQL database configured and connected to the backend,
**so that** the application can persist and retrieve data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL database provisioned (local development environment)
2. Database connection configuration using environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
3. Database migration tooling installed (Alembic/Sequelize/TypeORM)
4. Initial migration creates `users` table for authentication
5. Backend can successfully connect to database on startup
6. Database connection health check endpoint (`/api/health`) returns 200 when DB connected
7. Environment variable template (`.env.example`) documented with required DB configuration

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- `backend/src/config/database.js` - PostgreSQL connection pool configuration
- `backend/src/utils/migrate.js` - Custom migration system with 8 migrations
- `backend/src/index.js` - Server entry point with health check endpoint
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variable template

### Architecture Notes
**Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with connection pooling

**Connection Pooling Configuration**:
```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20,                    // Max connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 10000,   // Close idle connections after 10s
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000, // Timeout if no connection available
});
```

**Migration System**: Custom migration system (8 total migrations created):
1. Create users table
2. Create clients table
3. Create client_domains table
4. Create contacts table
5. Create tickets table
6. Create time_entries table
7. Create invoice_locks table
8. Create xero_connections table

**Database Schema - Users Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Environment Variables
Required in `backend/.env`:
- `DB_HOST=localhost`
- `DB_PORT=5432`
- `DB_NAME=ticketing_system`
- `DB_USER=postgres`
- `DB_PASSWORD=your_password`

### Testing
**Testing Strategy**: Manual testing for MVP

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Create local PostgreSQL database: `createdb ticketing_system`
- [x] Configure backend/.env with correct database credentials
- [x] Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
- [x] Start backend: `npm run dev:backend`
- [x] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health` returns 200
- [x] Verify users table exists in database: `psql ticketing_system -c "\dt"`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Solid foundational implementation with clean architecture and proper separation of concerns. The custom migration system is well-designed with transactional safety and idempotency. Connection pooling is properly configured. However, several production-readiness concerns exist around error handling and observability that should be addressed before deploying to production environments.

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean separation: config, utils, routes properly isolated
- Custom migration system is simple, maintainable, and transactional
- Connection pooling configured appropriately for workload
- Query helper abstracts common patterns effectively

### Improvements Checklist

**Production Readiness Concerns (Medium Priority):**
- [x] **SEC-001**: Remove `process.exit(-1)` from pool error handler ([database.js:28](backend/src/config/database.js#L28)) - ✅ **FIXED**: Replaced with error logging and graceful degradation
- [x] **SEC-002**: Disable query logging in production or sanitize SQL before logging ([database.js:37](backend/src/config/database.js#L37)) - ✅ **FIXED**: Query text only logged in development mode
- [x] **SEC-003**: Remove error message details from health check in production ([index.js:60](backend/src/index.js#L60)) - ✅ **FIXED**: Error details only exposed in development
- [x] **REL-001**: Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff - ✅ **FIXED**: Implemented 5-attempt retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)

**Low Priority Improvements:**
- [ ] Consider structured logging library (pino, winston) for better production observability
- [ ] Add connection pool metrics endpoint for monitoring (active/idle connections)
- [ ] Document migration rollback strategy (currently forward-only)

**Documentation Notes:**
- [ ] Minor discrepancy: Story notes say 10s idle timeout, implementation uses 30s (implementation is fine, just update docs if needed)

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ PASS (All concerns addressed)**

**Previous Findings (NOW FIXED):**
1. ~~**DoS Vulnerability**~~ - ✅ **FIXED**: Removed fatal process exit, server continues with graceful degradation
2. ~~**Information Disclosure**~~ - ✅ **FIXED**: Query text only logged in development mode
3. ~~**Error Message Leakage**~~ - ✅ **FIXED**: Error details only exposed in development

**Current Mitigations:**
- ✓ No hardcoded credentials
- ✓ Environment variable isolation
- ✓ Helmet security headers enabled
- ✓ Production-safe error handling
- ✓ Sanitized query logging
- ⚠️ Session secret has weak default (acceptable if overridden in production .env)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Ready for production deployment** (with proper .env configuration)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

**Strengths:**
- Connection pooling properly configured (max: 20, idle timeout: 30s, connection timeout: 2s)
- Query timing instrumentation aids performance debugging
- Efficient indexing strategy in migrations (10 indexes across 8 tables)

**Notes:**
- Pool size of 20 is appropriate for expected workload
- Consider monitoring query durations to identify slow queries as system grows

### Files Modified During Review

None - all issues documented for team decision.

### Re-Review Date: 2025-09-30 (Second Review)

### Verification of Fixes

All 4 previously identified issues have been successfully resolved:

**✅ SEC-001 - DoS Prevention:**
- Fixed in [database.js:26-30](backend/src/config/database.js#L26-30)
- Removed `process.exit(-1)`, now logs error and allows graceful degradation
- Server continues running, health check reports database status

**✅ SEC-002 - Query Logging Sanitization:**
- Fixed in [database.js:68-73](backend/src/config/database.js#L68-73)
- Environment-aware logging: full SQL only in development
- Production logs only duration and row counts

**✅ SEC-003 - Health Endpoint Security:**
- Fixed in [index.js:56-65](backend/src/index.js#L56-65)
- Error message details only exposed in development
- Production returns generic error response

**✅ REL-001 - Connection Retry Logic:**
- Fixed in [database.js:36-59](backend/src/config/database.js#L36-59) + [index.js:92-107](backend/src/index.js#L92-107)
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism (5 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Proper async startup with helpful error messages

**Additional Improvements Found:**
- ✓ JSDoc documentation added to `testConnection()`
- ✓ Consistent environment check pattern throughout
- ✓ Better startup error messaging with actionable guidance

### Updated NFR Assessment

**Security:** ✅ PASS (upgraded from CONCERNS)
**Performance:** ✅ PASS (maintained)
**Reliability:** ✅ PASS (upgraded from CONCERNS)
**Maintainability:** ✅ PASS (maintained)

### Gate Status

Gate: **✅ PASS** → [docs/qa/gates/1.2-database-setup.yml](docs/qa/gates/1.2-database-setup.yml)

### Recommended Status

**✅ Ready for Production**

All production readiness concerns have been addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities fixed (SEC-001, SEC-002, SEC-003)
- Connection reliability improved (REL-001)

### Office Add-in Manifest Requirements

**Manifest Format:** Office Add-ins require an XML manifest file that defines add-in metadata, permissions, and hosting configuration. Manifest must validate against Office Add-in XML Schema version 1.1. [Source: Office.js documentation]

**Required Manifest Elements:**
- `<Id>`: UUID uniquely identifying the add-in (generate once, never change)
- `<Version>`: Manifest version in format `1.0.0.0` (Office-specific versioning)
- `<ProviderName>`: Organization name (use "ZO, LLC")
- `<DisplayName>`: Add-in name shown in Outlook UI ("Email to Ticket Converter")
- `<Description>`: Brief description of add-in functionality
- `<Hosts>`: Supported Office applications (Mailbox for Outlook)
- `<Permissions>`: Required Office.js API permissions (Mail.Read for email metadata)
- `<SourceLocation>`: HTTPS URL where add-in task pane is hosted

**Permission Level:** Manifest must request `Mail.Read` permission to access email sender, subject, and metadata via Office.js Mail API. This is the minimum permission level needed for contact matching functionality. [Source: Office.js Mail API documentation]

**Icon Requirements:** Manifest requires icon URLs for 16x16, 32x32, and 80x80 pixel icons. For MVP, placeholder icons are acceptable (can use public image URLs or data URIs). Production icons should match ZO, LLC branding. [Source: Office Add-in manifest schema]

### File Locations and Structure

**Manifest Directory:** Create `/outlook-addin/manifest` directory for manifest XML files. This directory should contain both development and production manifest versions. [Source: [source-tree-organization.md](docs/architecture/source-tree-organization.md#new-file-organization-add-in-specific)]

**Development Manifest:**
- File: `/outlook-addin/manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.xml`
- Task pane URL: `https://localhost:5173` (matches Story 1.3 dev server)
- Should be committed to version control

**Production Manifest:**
- File: `/outlook-addin/manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.prod.xml`
- Task pane URL: `https://outlook-addin.zollc.com` (Railway deployment)
- Generated via npm script, should NOT be committed to git (add to .gitignore)

[Source: [source-tree-organization.md](docs/architecture/source-tree-organization.md#new-file-organization-add-in-specific)]

### Deployment Infrastructure Context

**Production Hosting:** Add-in will be deployed to Railway service at `https://outlook-addin.zollc.com`. This service will serve static files from `/outlook-addin/dist` directory after production build. [Source: [infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md](docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#enhancement-deployment-strategy)]

**Railway Service Configuration:**
- Service name: `outlook-addin`
- Custom domain: `outlook-addin.zollc.com`
- SSL: Auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificates
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build --workspace=outlook-addin`
- Start command: `npx serve -s outlook-addin/dist -p $PORT`

[Source: [infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md](docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#railway-service-configuration)]

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://ticketapi.zollc.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

[Source: [infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md](docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#railway-service-configuration)]

### Manifest Validation and Sideloading

**Office Add-in Validator:** Microsoft provides `office-addin-manifest` npm package for validating manifest XML files. Install globally: `npm install -g office-addin-manifest`. Validate with: `office-addin-manifest validate <path-to-manifest.xml>`. [Source: Microsoft Office Add-in documentation]

**Sideloading Process (Development):**
1. Open Outlook Web Access at outlook.office.com
2. Navigate to "Get Add-ins" button in toolbar
3. Select "My add-ins" tab
4. Click "Add from file" and upload manifest XML
5. Verify add-in icon appears in Outlook sidebar

**Sideloading Requirements:**
- Manifest URL must be HTTPS (localhost with self-signed cert is acceptable for dev)
- Manifest must pass XML schema validation
- Task pane URL must be accessible from browser

[Source: Microsoft Office Add-in sideloading documentation]

### NPM Script for Production Manifest

**Manifest Generation Strategy:** Use npm script to generate production manifest by copying development manifest and replacing localhost URL with production URL. This avoids manual duplication and reduces chance of errors.

**Script Implementation Example:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "manifest:prod": "sed 's|https://localhost:5173|https://outlook-addin.zollc.com|g' manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.xml > manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.prod.xml"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Cross-platform compatibility may require using Node.js script instead of shell commands. Consider using `fs` module for file operations.

### Integration with Existing Standards

**TypeScript Standards:** Manifest is XML, not TypeScript. No TypeScript standards apply to this story. [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#typescript-standards)]

**Office.js Integration:** Manifest enables Office.js API access by requesting Mail.Read permission. Office.js initialization code (Office.onReady()) already added in Story 1.3. [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#enhancement-specific-standards)]

**Error Handling:** Manifest validation errors should be caught and fixed before sideloading. Sideloading errors (XML parsing, permission errors) should be documented in README.md troubleshooting section. [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#error-handling)]

### Security Considerations

**HTTPS Requirement:** Office Add-ins MUST be served over HTTPS, even in development. Manifest SourceLocation must use HTTPS URLs. Self-signed certificates acceptable for localhost development. [Source: [security-integration.md](docs/architecture/security-integration.md#enhancement-security-requirements)]

**Permission Scope:** Manifest requests Mail.Read permission, which grants read-only access to email metadata (sender, subject, body). This is the minimum permission needed for contact matching. No write permissions requested. [Source: Office.js security documentation]

**Icon URLs:** Manifest icon URLs should be HTTPS. For MVP, use public placeholder image service or data URI. Production icons should be hosted on same domain as add-in (`outlook-addin.zollc.com`). [Source: Office Add-in security best practices]

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual testing only for manifest creation and validation. No automated tests required for XML manifest files. [Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements)]

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
1. **Manifest Validation:**
   - Run Office Add-in Validator on development manifest
   - Verify no validation errors or warnings
   - Verify manifest adheres to XML Schema 1.1

2. **Sideloading Test:**
   - Sideload development manifest in Outlook Web Access
   - Verify add-in icon appears in Outlook UI
   - Verify no XML parsing errors during sideload
   - Verify task pane URL points to correct localhost address

3. **Production Manifest Generation:**
   - Run `npm run manifest:prod` script
   - Verify production manifest file created
   - Verify production manifest contains `outlook-addin.zollc.com` URL (not localhost)
   - Verify production manifest validates successfully

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui)]

**No Unit Tests Required:** This story creates XML configuration files. No backend logic or UI components implemented. Automated tests not applicable. [Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements)]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation completed without blocking issues.

### Completion Notes List

1. **Manifest Creation**: Created Office Add-in manifest with UUID `a5598e8c-d985-4ada-aced-2912195945a2`, version 1.0.0.0, requesting ReadItem permission (Mail.Read equivalent) for email metadata access.

2. **Schema Validation Fixes**: Initial manifest validation failed due to incorrect element ordering. Fixed by moving `<Requirements>` before `<FormSettings>` and adding required `<Rule>` element before `<VersionOverrides>` per Office Add-in XML Schema 1.1 specification.

3. **Production Manifest Script**: Created cross-platform Node.js script (`scripts/generate-prod-manifest.js`) to generate production manifest, replacing all `https://localhost:5173` URLs with `https://outlook-addin.zollc.com`. Script accessible via `npm run manifest:prod`.

4. **Gitignore Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` to track development manifest (`outlook-addin-manifest.xml`) while ignoring production manifest (`*.prod.xml`) as it's a generated file.

5. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive sections to README.md covering:
   - Manifest validation using Office Add-in Validator
   - Production manifest generation workflow
   - Step-by-step sideloading instructions for Outlook Web
   - Troubleshooting guide for common sideloading errors
   - Manifest refresh workflow after code changes

6. **Validation Success**: Both development and production manifests validate successfully with Office Add-in Validator. All required fields present: UUID, version, provider, display name, description, source location, permissions, host specification, and icon URLs.

7. **Sideloading Preparation**: All prerequisites for sideloading documented. Actual sideloading test requires Outlook Web access with Office 365 account, which is deferred to user testing phase.

### File List

**Created:**
- `outlook-addin/manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.xml` - Development manifest with localhost URLs
- `outlook-addin/scripts/generate-prod-manifest.js` - Production manifest generation script

**Modified:**
- `outlook-addin/.gitignore` - Added production manifest ignore pattern
- `outlook-addin/package.json` - Added `manifest:prod` script
- `outlook-addin/README.md` - Added manifest validation and sideloading sections

**Generated (not tracked):**
- `outlook-addin/manifest/outlook-addin-manifest.prod.xml` - Production manifest (gitignored)

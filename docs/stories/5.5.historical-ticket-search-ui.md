# Story 5.5: Historical Ticket Search UI

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a user interface to search for past tickets by keyword, client, or state,
**so that** I can find historical work for billing disputes or reference (FR12).

## Note

**This story was implemented together with Story 5.4** as a single cohesive feature. The TicketsPage component provides both the backend integration and user interface for ticket search and filtering.

For complete implementation details, acceptance criteria, technical specifications, and testing guidance, please refer to:

**[Story 5.4: Historical Ticket Search Implementation](./5.4.historical-ticket-search-implementation.md)**

## Summary of Implementation

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ TicketsPage accessible from main navigation ("Tickets")
- ✅ Search form with keyword input (client, contact, ticket ID)
- ✅ State filter dropdown (Open, Recently Closed, All Closed)
- ✅ Real-time search execution (client-side filtering)
- ✅ Results table (desktop) and card view (mobile)
- ✅ Clickable rows navigate to ticket detail
- ✅ Empty states for no results scenarios
- ✅ Loading indicators during data fetch
- ✅ "Clear" button to reset search
- ✅ Filter state preserved in URL query params

**Deviation from Original PRD:**
- Combined Stories 5.4 and 5.5 into single implementation
- Client-side filtering instead of backend search API
- No date range pickers (can be added if needed)
- No advanced billable/non-billable filter (can be added if needed)

**Components Created:**
- `TicketsPage.tsx` - Main page with search and filtering
- `SearchBar.tsx` - Reusable search input component
- `PageHeader.tsx` - Page header with title and actions

**See Story 5.4 for:**
- Detailed acceptance criteria mapping
- Complete technical specifications
- API integration details
- Testing scenarios and procedures

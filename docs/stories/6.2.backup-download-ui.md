# Story 6.2: Backup Download UI

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to download database backups from the Settings page,
**so that** I can preserve critical system data and configuration locally for disaster recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Settings page contains new "Backup & Restore" section below existing sections
2. "Download Backup Now" button triggers POST /api/backup/generate endpoint
3. Loading indicator displays during backup generation (operation may take several seconds)
4. Browser automatically downloads backup ZIP file on success with timestamp filename
5. Error messages display for backup failures (ServerError, RateLimitExceeded) with user-friendly text
6. Help text explains backup contents (database + environment configuration) and security warnings
7. Only authenticated users can access backup download functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 6.1 (Backend Backup Generation API):
- Backend endpoint POST /api/backup/generate successfully implemented
- Returns ZIP file with `Content-Type: application/zip` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.zip` headers
- Backup generation can take time (5-minute timeout configured on backend)
- Rate limiting: 1 backup per 5 minutes per user (returns 429 RateLimitExceeded error)
- Authentication required via requireAuth middleware (returns 401 Unauthorized if not authenticated)
- Comprehensive error handling on backend: ServerError for pg_dump failures, file system errors, ZIP creation errors
- Backup includes database.sql and environment-config.json in ZIP
- Timestamp format: `backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.zip` (17 characters total)

### Existing Settings Page Pattern

[Source: frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx from Story 4.7]

**Settings Page Structure:**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
    <PageHeader title="Settings" />
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Xero Integration Section */}
      <SettingsSection title="..." description="...">
        {/* Content */}
      </SettingsSection>

      {/* Invoice Configuration Section */}
      <SettingsSection title="..." description="...">
        {/* Content */}
      </SettingsSection>

      {/* ADD BackupSection HERE */}

      {/* General Settings Section */}
      <SettingsSection title="..." description="...">
        {/* Content */}
      </SettingsSection>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**SettingsSection Component Pattern:**
[Source: frontend/src/components/SettingsSection.tsx]
```tsx
<SettingsSection
  title="Section Title"
  description="Section description"
>
  {/* Section content with buttons, forms, etc. */}
</SettingsSection>
```

**Button Pattern (from XeroConnectionCard):**
```tsx
<Button
  variant="default"
  onClick={handleAction}
  disabled={isLoading}
  className="w-full sm:w-auto"
>
  {isLoading ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
      Loading Text
    </>
  ) : (
    'Button Text'
  )}
</Button>
```

**Toast Pattern (from Settings.tsx):**
```tsx
import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast';

const { toast } = useToast();

// Success toast
toast({
  title: 'Success Title',
  description: 'Success message',
});

// Error toast
toast({
  title: 'Error Title',
  description: 'Error message',
  variant: 'destructive',
});
```

### API Service Layer Pattern

[Source: frontend/src/lib/api/xero.ts, frontend/src/lib/api/invoices.ts]

**File Download Pattern:**
```typescript
// API Service Layer (backup.ts)
export const backupApi = {
  async generateBackup(): Promise<void> {
    const response = await fetch('/api/backup/generate', {
      method: 'POST',
      credentials: 'include', // Include session cookie
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle error responses
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new Error(errorData.message || 'Backup generation failed');
    }

    // Get filename from Content-Disposition header
    const contentDisposition = response.headers.get('Content-Disposition');
    const filenameMatch = contentDisposition?.match(/filename="?(.+?)"?$/);
    const filename = filenameMatch?.[1] || 'backup.zip';

    // Create blob from response
    const blob = await response.blob();

    // Trigger browser download
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = filename;
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a.click();
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    document.body.removeChild(a);
  },
};
```

### React Query Mutation Pattern

[Source: frontend/src/hooks/useXero.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useInvoiceConfig.ts]

**Mutation Hook Pattern:**
```typescript
// useBackup.ts
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { backupApi } from '@/lib/api/backup';

export const useGenerateBackup = () => {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: backupApi.generateBackup,
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Optional: Add success handling here if needed
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      // Optional: Add error handling here if needed
      console.error('Backup generation failed:', error);
    },
  });
};
```

**Usage in Component:**
```tsx
const generateBackupMutation = useGenerateBackup();

const handleDownload = () => {
  generateBackupMutation.mutate();
};

// Access state
const isLoading = generateBackupMutation.isPending;
const isError = generateBackupMutation.isError;
const error = generateBackupMutation.error;
```

### Error Handling

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md, Story 6.1]

**Backend Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "ServerError",
  "message": "Failed to generate backup due to pg_dump failure"
}
```

**Possible Error Types from POST /api/backup/generate:**
- **401 Unauthorized:** Not authenticated (redirected to login by frontend)
- **429 RateLimitExceeded:** Rate limit exceeded (1 backup per 5 minutes per user)
  - Message: "Too many backup requests. Please try again in 5 minutes."
- **500 ServerError:** Various server-side failures (pg_dump failure, file system errors, ZIP creation errors)
  - Message: User-friendly error message from backend

**Frontend Error Handling:**
```typescript
// In BackupSection component
if (generateBackupMutation.isError) {
  const error = generateBackupMutation.error as Error;
  let errorMessage = 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.';

  if (error.message.includes('Rate limit')) {
    errorMessage = 'Backup rate limit exceeded. Please wait 5 minutes before trying again.';
  } else if (error.message.includes('Failed to generate backup')) {
    errorMessage = 'Failed to generate backup. Please try again or contact support.';
  }

  toast({
    title: 'Backup Failed',
    description: errorMessage,
    variant: 'destructive',
  });
}
```

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Authentication:**
- All Settings page routes protected by authentication (existing middleware)
- POST /api/backup/generate requires session cookie (credentials: 'include' in fetch)
- 401 response if not authenticated (frontend redirects to login)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Backend enforces 1 backup per 5 minutes per user
- Frontend displays user-friendly error message when limit exceeded
- No client-side rate limiting needed (backend handles enforcement)

**CSRF Protection:**
- Global CSRF protection applied to all POST routes (existing middleware)
- No additional CSRF handling needed in frontend

**Data Security:**
- Warn users about backup file sensitivity: "Keep backup files secure - they contain sensitive credentials"
- No validation of backup contents on frontend (backend handles all logic)

### Accessibility

[Source: WCAG 2.1 AA standards, shadcn/ui best practices]

**Button Accessibility:**
- Use semantic `<button>` element (shadcn/ui Button component)
- Add `aria-label` for screen readers: "Download database backup"
- Loading state: `aria-busy="true"` when `isPending === true`
- Disabled state: `disabled={isPending}` prevents clicks during operation

**Loading State Announcements:**
- Loading spinner visible to sighted users
- Button text changes to "Generating Backup..." for screen reader users
- Toast notifications automatically announced by ARIA live regions

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Button accessible via Tab key
- Button activated via Enter or Space key
- Focus visible (default shadcn/ui behavior)

**Color Contrast:**
- Primary button meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1)
- Error toasts use destructive variant with sufficient contrast

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library (planned for future)

**Test File Location:** `frontend/src/components/__tests__/BackupSection.test.tsx`

**Required Test Cases:**
1. Component renders with "Download Backup Now" button
2. Button click triggers generateBackup mutation
3. Loading state shows spinner and disables button
4. Success toast displayed after successful download
5. Error toast displayed for ServerError
6. Error toast displayed for RateLimitExceeded
7. Help text displays backup contents and security warning
8. Accessibility: Button has aria-label, loading state announced

**MVP Testing Approach:**
Manual testing sufficient for MVP. Automated tests are enhancement for future.

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Navigate to Settings page
- [ ] Verify "Backup & Restore" section appears below Invoice Configuration
- [ ] Click "Download Backup Now" button
- [ ] Verify loading spinner appears and button is disabled
- [ ] Verify backup ZIP file downloads automatically with timestamp filename
- [ ] Verify success toast appears: "Backup downloaded successfully"
- [ ] Test rate limiting: Try downloading backup again immediately
- [ ] Verify error toast appears: "Backup rate limit exceeded. Please wait 5 minutes before trying again."
- [ ] Test error handling: Disconnect from database (simulate server error)
- [ ] Verify error toast appears: "Failed to generate backup. Please try again or contact support."
- [ ] Verify help text clearly explains backup contents and security warning
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation: Tab to button, press Enter to trigger download
- [ ] Test responsive design: Button full width on mobile, auto width on desktop

### Component Design Specification

**BackupSection Component:**

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { SettingsSection } from '@/components/SettingsSection';
import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast';
import { useGenerateBackup } from '@/hooks/useBackup';
import { Loader2, Download } from 'lucide-react';

export const BackupSection = () => {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const generateBackupMutation = useGenerateBackup();

  const handleDownload = async () => {
    try {
      await generateBackupMutation.mutateAsync();
      toast({
        title: 'Backup Downloaded',
        description: 'Your backup has been downloaded successfully.',
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling with specific messages
      const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'An unexpected error occurred';

      let userMessage = 'Failed to generate backup. Please try again or contact support.';
      if (errorMessage.includes('Rate limit')) {
        userMessage = 'Backup rate limit exceeded. Please wait 5 minutes before trying again.';
      }

      toast({
        title: 'Backup Failed',
        description: userMessage,
        variant: 'destructive',
      });
    }
  };

  return (
    <SettingsSection
      title="Backup & Restore"
      description="Download a complete backup of your database and configuration for disaster recovery."
    >
      <div className="space-y-4">
        {/* Help Text */}
        <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-4">
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Backup includes:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm text-muted-foreground list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
            <li>Complete database (all tickets, clients, contacts, invoices)</li>
            <li>Environment configuration (Xero tokens, encryption keys)</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-destructive font-medium">
            ⚠️ Keep backup files secure - they contain sensitive credentials
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Download Button */}
        <Button
          onClick={handleDownload}
          disabled={generateBackupMutation.isPending}
          className="w-full sm:w-auto"
          aria-label="Download database backup"
        >
          {generateBackupMutation.isPending ? (
            <>
              <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
              Generating Backup...
            </>
          ) : (
            <>
              <Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Download Backup Now
            </>
          )}
        </Button>

        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
          Backup generation may take several seconds for large databases. You can download one backup every 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </SettingsSection>
  );
};
```

### Security Review

**✅ All Security Requirements Met:**
1. **Authentication:** Settings page + backend requireAuth middleware protect endpoint
2. **CSRF Protection:** CSRF token fetched and included in POST request
3. **Rate Limiting:** Backend enforces 1 backup per 5 minutes (Story 6.1)
4. **User Education:** Prominent warning about backup file sensitivity
5. **Session Management:** Credentials include for session-based auth
6. **Error Messages:** No sensitive information leaked in error messages

**No security concerns found.**

### Performance Considerations

**✅ Performance Optimized:**
- Blob download pattern prevents memory issues
- Stream-based ZIP creation on backend
- Proper URL cleanup after download (revokeObjectURL)
- Loading states prevent duplicate requests
- Rate limiting prevents DoS abuse

**User Experience Notes:**
- Loading spinner provides feedback during potentially long operation
- Help text sets expectation: "may take several seconds for large databases"
- Rate limiting communicated: "You can download one backup every 5 minutes"

**No performance issues found.**

### Manual Testing Results (User Confirmed)

User successfully performed manual testing:
✅ Backup downloaded as ZIP file with timestamp filename

# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Ticketing System with an **Outlook Web Add-in for Email-to-Ticket Conversion**. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of this new feature while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing project architecture (documented in `/docs/architecture/`) by defining how the new Outlook Add-in components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements. All architectural decisions respect the established technology stack, coding standards, and deployment patterns.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys - 10 minutes

**Description:** Deep dive into root problem to understand true motivations beyond surface request

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Surface problem:** Don't want to spend time/energy creating ticket notes
2. **Deeper layer:** Notes are low-importance defensive documentation for rare billing disputes - just need "something" for reference
3. **Core emotional issue:** User *hates* making notes, not just finding them inefficient
4. **Root cause:** Busywork creates friction in a job being tolerated while planning 5-year career transition
5. **Why solve it now:** Five years is long enough that reducing friction is worthwhile investment

**Insights Discovered:**

- This isn't about creating high-quality notes - it's about **removing friction from tedious tasks**
- The bar for "good enough" is intentionally low - just need memory joggers for rare billing dispute conversations
- Speed and ease of use matter far more than summary perfection or comprehensiveness
- Solution should minimize cognitive load and context switching from enjoyable work
- Emotional experience (reducing hate/frustration) is as important as time savings

**Notable Connections:**

- Career transition context explains "good enough" acceptance criteria - not building for 20-year legacy
- Rare billing disputes mean notes are defensive documentation, not primary value creation
- Current practice (using email subject lines) sets a very low quality bar that AI will easily exceed

### SCAMPER Method - 20 minutes

**Description:** Systematic exploration of feature variations using Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse prompts

#### S - Substitute Ideas

1. **Conditional automatic generation** - Only auto-generate when contact match exists to prevent token waste on junk/vendor/partner emails
2. **Voice-to-text substitution** - Not needed; already using Superwhisper effectively
3. **Metadata extraction** - Insufficient for notes field; need actual content summaries
4. **Proactive generation timing** - Generate immediately when contact matches (vs. just-in-time or batch)
5. **Single quality tier** - Only "quick summary" mode; no detailed/custom options needed

#### C - Combine Ideas

6. **Suggested billable hours** - AI estimates time from email content (low risk since user reviews anyway)
7. **Multi-email thread summarization** - Default behavior to create coherent single description from entire conversation
8. **Learning from past patterns** - Simple approach: include 3-5 recent similar tickets as few-shot examples in prompt (80% benefit, minimal complexity)
9. **~~Categories/tags~~** - Not applicable; system doesn't use these

#### A - Adapt Ideas

10. **Email sanitization (reader mode pattern)** - Strip signatures, disclaimers, legal footers before AI processing to reduce tokens and noise
11. **Two distinct outputs:**
    - **Description/Title:** One-line, invoice-friendly (fits on billing line item)
    - **Notes:** Summary of email thread for reference/memory jogging
12. **Minimal UI constraint** - Outlook add-in has severe space limitations, already nearly full
13. **Auto-populate immediately (Option A)** - Fill form fields right away so user can verify AI summary jogs memory before submission

#### M - Modify/Magnify Ideas

14. **Attachment summarization (Phase 2)** - Include PDFs and .doc(x) files; ignore inline images; only process attached images if identifiable as screenshots (ship later)
15. **Smart minification** - Don't over-summarize short emails; keep output proportional to input
16. **Single model strategy** - Use GPT-5 mini for everything (no dynamic model switching)
17. **Model configurability** - Build in ability to change models in future

#### P - Put to Other Uses Ideas

18. **AI for ticket updates** - Use same summarization when adding emails to existing tickets (leverage recently-shipped update capability)
19. **AI-powered ticket matching** - Determine if new email relates to existing open ticket and suggest with confidence UI: "This seems related to Ticket #123 - use this one?" with accept/reject

#### E - Eliminate Ideas

20. **System-wide API key** - Single API key (not per-user), with interface for entry/update
21. **Default system prompt with editability** - Start with good default, but make changeable over time (avoid hard-coding)
22. **Eliminate manual generation button** - Always proactive; okay creating first ticket manually per contact
23. **Keep edit capability** - Must be able to directly edit AI output (regeneration-only would be frustrating)
24. **Admin settings on website (Option A)** - Add API key + system prompt to existing settings page; store in backend DB; add-in retrieves via existing API

#### R - Reverse/Rearrange Ideas

25. No compelling reversal/rearrangement ideas identified

**Insights Discovered:**

- **Proactive + minimal UI = perfect fit** - Auto-generation on contact-match eliminates need for buttons/controls in cramped add-in space
- **Phase 2 strategy** - Ship email summarization first, add attachment processing later for faster initial value
- **Infrastructure leverage** - Existing contact matching, open ticket display, backend settings page, and API connections reduce implementation complexity
- **Single model simplicity** - GPT-5 mini for all cases avoids decision complexity while maintaining future flexibility

**Notable Connections:**

- Contact-match gating solves both token cost (no junk email processing) and UX activation (only for actual tickets)
- AI ticket matching builds naturally on existing "show open tickets for client" feature
- Website settings page already exists for accounting integration - natural home for AI config

### Role Playing - 15 minutes

**Description:** Consider feature from different stakeholder perspectives to identify missed concerns or opportunities

#### Perspective 1: Future You (2-3 years, closer to career exit)

**Ideas Generated:**

- Grateful for time saved on busywork that doesn't matter
- Wish I'd automated/offloaded even more business processes in general
- No specific future-proofing concerns identified

**Insights:**
- Core value proposition holds over time
- Suggests appetite for additional automation features beyond this initial AI implementation

#### Perspective 2: Your Client (receiving invoices)

**Ideas Generated:**

- Won't likely notice AI vs. manual generation (AI quality is excellent in 2025)
- **Probably prefer AI descriptions** over current default practice (using email subject line)
- Most people write terrible email subjects, so AI is quality upgrade not just time-saver
- Manual override capability for line items provides trust/safety net for incorrect entries

**Insights:**
- **AI summaries are a quality improvement** for clients, not just an efficiency gain for user
- Current practice (email subject as ticket description) is acknowledged as poor quality
- Validates that "good enough" bar is actually quite low

#### Perspective 3: IT Security/Privacy Conscious User

**Ideas Generated:**

- No major concerns - user is third-party IT so confidential/personal info shouldn't be in emails anyway
- Email sanitization (signature stripping) is sufficient
- No special compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- No opt-out mechanism needed

**Insights:**
- Security/privacy concerns are minimal for this use case
- Third-party IT context means less sensitive data exposure risk
- Simplifies implementation - no need for complex PII detection or opt-out flows

**Notable Connections:**

- Future automation appetite suggests this could be pilot for broader AI integration
- Client quality perspective reframes this from "automation" to "quality improvement"
- Security simplicity removes potential implementation blockers

---

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Emotional Design Matters**: The solution must address the "hate" of busywork, not just save time. User experience of friction removal is primary success metric.

- **Good Enough is a Feature**: Low bar for quality ("just need something") enables aggressive simplification. Don't over-engineer for perfection.

- **Proactive > Manual**: Auto-triggering on contact-match solves three problems simultaneously: eliminates button (UI space), prevents token waste (only real tickets), removes decision fatigue (one less thing to think about).

- **Existing Infrastructure is Gold**: Contact matching, open ticket display, backend settings page, and API connections make this feature much simpler than greenfield. Always check what already exists.

- **AI as Quality Upgrade**: Reframing from "automation" to "quality improvement" (better than email subject lines) strengthens value proposition to clients, not just user.

- **Phase 2 Discipline**: Clear separation of Phase 1 (email summarization) vs. Phase 2 (attachments, ticket matching, updates) prevents scope creep while maintaining future vision.

- **Model Flexibility Future-Proofs**: Even while choosing GPT-5 mini now, building configurability prepares for rapid AI model evolution without code changes.

- **Career Context Informs Design**: 5-year timeline and career transition plans explain "good enough" acceptance criteria and hint at broader automation appetite.

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- Five Whys uncovered emotional/contextual factors (career transition, hate vs. inefficiency) that shaped design priorities
- SCAMPER systematically generated diverse ideas while maintaining focus on implementation specifics
- Role Playing validated client-facing quality improvement angle and eliminated security concerns
- Balanced approach kept exploration grounded in actionable features vs. pure ideation
- User's existing system knowledge enabled quick identification of infrastructure leverage opportunities

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **Billable hours estimation accuracy**: How well can AI predict time from email content? What calibration is needed?
- **Ticket matching semantic similarity**: What algorithm/approach for determining email-to-ticket relevance? Confidence thresholds?
- **Attachment processing complexity**: What's realistic for Phase 2? PDF text extraction vs. full document understanding vs. screenshot OCR?
- **Pattern learning effectiveness**: Do few-shot examples actually improve style matching? What's performance impact?
- **Broader automation opportunities**: What other business processes have similar "hate the busywork" profiles worth addressing?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Morphological Analysis**: Systematically explore combinations of configuration options (model Ã— email length Ã— output detail Ã— trigger timing) to find optimal parameter sets
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge "must store API key in backend" or "must use external AI" assumptions - are there alternative architectures?
- **User Journey Mapping**: Detailed flow mapping for edge cases (failed API calls, timeout handling, regeneration UX, first-time setup)

### Questions That Emerged

- What happens when OpenAI API is unavailable or times out? Fallback behavior?
- How to handle rate limits or token quotas? Warning system? Graceful degradation?
- Should there be usage analytics/monitoring for AI feature adoption and quality?
- What's the regeneration UX if user doesn't like AI output? New button? Or just manual edit?
- How to communicate AI vs. manual ticket creation to clients (if at all)?
- Should system prompt have version control or change history for iteration tracking?
- What's the error message UX for missing/invalid API key configuration?
- How to handle multi-language emails? Does GPT-5 mini handle well enough?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:**
  - Technical architecture deep-dive (API integration patterns, error handling, caching strategies)
  - Prompt engineering workshop (craft and test actual prompts for dual output generation)
  - Phase 2 feature prioritization (billable hours vs. ticket matching vs. updates - which first?)

- **Recommended timeframe:** After MVP implementation begins, reconvene for prompt refinement and Phase 2 planning (2-3 weeks)

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Sample email threads (various lengths, complexities) for prompt testing
  - Initial API integration POC to validate technical approach
  - User feedback from early manual testing of generated summaries

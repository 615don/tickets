# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic Goal:** Establish a production-ready foundation including project repository, development environment, CI/CD pipeline, basic authentication system, and deploy a minimal working application to cloud hosting. This epic delivers a secured, deployable application framework that subsequent epics will build upon.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Repository Initialization

As a **developer**,
I want **a properly configured monorepo with frontend and backend scaffolding**,
so that **I have a clean foundation to build the application with appropriate tooling and structure**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository created with appropriate `.gitignore` for chosen tech stack (Node.js/Python)
2. Monorepo structure established with separate `/frontend` and `/backend` directories
3. Frontend framework initialized (React/Vue) with TypeScript configuration
4. Backend framework initialized (Express/FastAPI) with basic project structure
5. Package manager configuration files present (package.json or requirements.txt)
6. README.md exists with basic project description and setup instructions
7. Development environment can be started locally (both frontend and backend running)

## Story 1.2: Database Setup & Connection

As a **developer**,
I want **a PostgreSQL database configured and connected to the backend**,
so that **the application can persist and retrieve data**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. PostgreSQL database provisioned (local development environment)
2. Database connection configuration using environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
3. Database migration tooling installed (Alembic/Sequelize/TypeORM)
4. Initial migration creates `users` table for authentication
5. Backend can successfully connect to database on startup
6. Database connection health check endpoint (`/api/health`) returns 200 when DB connected
7. Environment variable template (`.env.example`) documented with required DB configuration

## Story 1.3: Basic Authentication System

As a **user**,
I want **to log in with username and password**,
so that **only I can access the ticketing system**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User registration endpoint creates user with bcrypt-hashed password
2. Login endpoint validates credentials and creates session with HTTP-only cookie
3. Logout endpoint clears session and invalidates cookie
4. Protected API routes reject requests without valid session (401 Unauthorized)
5. Frontend login page renders with username/password form
6. Successful login redirects to dashboard (placeholder page acceptable)
7. Frontend stores authentication state and redirects unauthenticated users to login
8. Password minimum requirements enforced (8+ characters)

## Story 1.4: CI/CD Pipeline & Production Deployment

As a **developer**,
I want **automated deployment to production hosting on main branch commits**,
so that **changes are continuously deployed without manual intervention**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Cloud hosting platform account configured (Heroku/Railway/Render/DigitalOcean)
2. Production PostgreSQL database provisioned on hosting platform
3. CI/CD pipeline configured to deploy on merge to `main` branch
4. Database migrations run automatically on deployment
5. Environment variables configured in hosting platform (DB credentials, session secret)
6. Application accessible via HTTPS URL
7. Health check endpoint returns 200 on production deployment
8. Automated daily database backups configured on hosting platform (NFR7)

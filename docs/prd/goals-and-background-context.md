# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate revenue leakage from forgotten billable hours by enabling real-time ticket logging
- Reduce ticket creation time from minutes to under 10 seconds (target: 5 seconds)
- Decrease monthly administrative overhead from ~4 hours to under 1 hour
- Enable same-day invoice generation at month-end through seamless Xero integration
- Provide transparent, dispute-proof billing documentation for all client work
- Support 100% billable time capture with minimal friction during active work

## Background Context

Solo IT consultants and small IT consulting firms billing hourly face a critical challenge: existing ticketing systems designed for team collaboration impose unnecessary complexity that directly causes revenue loss. Current systems require slow-loading dropdowns, multiple forced fields, and multi-step workflows that transform simple billing documentation into a multi-minute interruption. This friction leads consultants to defer ticket creation, resulting in forgotten billable hoursâ€”potentially $5,000-10,000 in annual revenue loss for a typical consultant billing 85-100 hours monthly.

This PRD defines an MVP ticketing system purpose-built for billing documentation rather than task management. By reducing required fields at creation to just three essentials (client, contact, time) and enabling rich context capture at closure, the system meets consultants where they work and eliminates the barrier causing revenue leakage. The solution focuses exclusively on the billing workflow: capture time during work, review and adjust before month-end, and generate detailed Xero invoices with per-ticket line items.

# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The system prioritizes **speed and simplicity** over feature richness. The interface should feel lightweight and responsive, with minimal cognitive load at every interaction. The primary UX goal is to make ticket creation so fast and frictionless that users log time in real-time during work rather than deferring to memory. Secondary UX goals include confidence during month-end review (clear visibility of all billable work) and zero-confusion invoice generation (obvious what will be sent to Xero before pushing).

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Fast-form philosophy:** Ticket creation uses minimal form fields with smart defaults, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and instant submission without confirmation dialogs
- **Deferred detail capture:** System embraces the workflow of "quick capture now, rich context later" - users can return to tickets to add descriptions/notes when context is fresh
- **Dashboard-centric navigation:** Single dashboard view as home base showing open tickets, recently closed, and quick-access to month-end review
- **Inline editing:** Edit ticket details, time entries, and descriptions directly in list views without modal popups or page transitions where possible
- **Progressive disclosure:** Advanced features (search, historical tickets, client/contact management) hidden behind secondary navigation to keep primary workflow clean

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Dashboard (Home)** - Primary landing page showing open tickets, recently closed tickets, and quick stats (current month hours)
2. **Create Ticket Form** - Minimal form with Client dropdown, Contact dropdown, Time input, and optional Description/Notes
3. **Ticket Detail/Edit View** - Display and edit all ticket details including multiple time entries, with ability to add/edit description and notes
4. **Pre-Invoice Review Screen** - Month-end review showing all tickets to be invoiced, grouped by client, with totals and highlighting of missing descriptions
5. **Client Management** - CRUD interface for clients (company name, domains, Xero ID, contract type)
6. **Contact Management** - CRUD interface for contacts (name, email, associated client)
7. **Historical Ticket Search** - Simple search interface for finding closed tickets by client, date range, or keyword

## Accessibility: None

No formal accessibility compliance requirements for MVP. Standard browser accessibility features should work (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility for form fields), but WCAG conformance is not a formal requirement.

## Branding

Clean, professional, minimal aesthetic. Favor function over form. No specific brand guidelines or color palette defined for MVP. Suggested approach: Simple neutral color scheme (blues/grays for professionalism), clear typography optimized for readability, and generous whitespace to reduce visual clutter. Avoid unnecessary animations or decorative elements that could slow perceived performance.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary target is desktop browsers (where most work happens), with responsive design ensuring usability on tablets and mobile phones. Mobile experience should support common on-the-go tasks like quick ticket creation and viewing recent tickets, but month-end invoice review and client/contact management can be desktop-optimized.

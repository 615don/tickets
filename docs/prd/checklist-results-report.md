# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 92%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right - The scope is tightly focused on the core billing workflow with clear boundaries between MVP and Phase 2 features.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready - The PRD provides sufficient detail, clear requirements, and appropriate technical guidance for the Architect to begin detailed design.

**Most Critical Concerns:** All resolved - Xero dependency documented (NFR11), client/contact deletion rules defined (FR19, FR20, Story 2.7), and timezone strategy specified (Technical Assumptions).

## Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |

| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - explicit scope boundaries, rationale documented |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None - clear UX vision, interaction paradigms, core screens |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None - 20 FRs covering all MVP features, testable and unambiguous |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None - 11 NFRs covering performance, security, reliability, Xero dependency |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - logical sequencing, appropriate sizing, clear dependencies |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - clear tech stack recommendations, architecture decisions, timezone strategy |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS    | Xero dependency in NFR11, cascade delete rules in FR19/FR20 |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - consistent terminology, well-structured, comprehensive |

## Validation Summary

âœ… **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. All high-priority issues have been resolved. The epic structure provides clear sequencing, stories are appropriately sized for AI agent execution, and acceptance criteria are testable and complete.

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem-solution fit derived from comprehensive brief
- Excellent requirement traceability (all FRs map to brief's MVP scope)
- Logical epic sequencing with clear dependencies
- Appropriate MVP scope with well-defined Phase 2 boundaries
- Detailed acceptance criteria enabling confident implementation
- Realistic timeline with built-in buffer (4-6 weeks, 35 stories)

**Timeline Assessment:**
- 5 Epics, 36 total stories
- Estimated at 2-4 hours per story (AI agent session size)
- Total: 72-144 hours of focused development
- Target timeline: 4-6 weeks (160-240 hours at 40hr/week)
- Assessment: **Realistic** with buffer for integration testing, bug fixes, and Xero API learning curve

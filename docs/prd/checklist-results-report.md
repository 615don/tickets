# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right - The scope is laser-focused on the core problem (friction in ticket creation from email) with clear boundaries between MVP and Phase 2 features. The 5 epics deliver incremental value while maintaining tight focus on the Brief's stated goal of reducing ticket creation time from minutes to seconds.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready - The PRD provides comprehensive technical guidance, clear requirements with testable acceptance criteria, and appropriate constraints for the Architect to begin detailed design. The critical technical unknowns are documented with research spike in Epic 1.

**Most Critical Concerns:**
- **RESOLVED:** Authentication strategy flagged as unknown but Epic 1.2 explicitly addresses this with research requirement
- **RESOLVED:** Domain matching infrastructure dependency documented in Technical Assumptions with clear assumption that it exists from main app
- **NOTED:** Office.js API capabilities unvalidated, but Epic 1.1 research spike de-risks this before feature development

## Validation Summary

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. All categories passed validation. The epic structure provides clear sequencing with Epic 1 validating technical feasibility before feature development, and stories are appropriately sized for AI agent execution (2-4 hour sessions).

**Strengths:**
- **Problem-solution fit derived from comprehensive Brief** - Clear connection from pain points to features
- **Excellent requirement traceability** - All FRs map directly to Brief's MVP Core Features
- **Logical epic sequencing** - Epic 1 de-risks technical unknowns before investing in features
- **Appropriate MVP scope** - No feature creep; AI generation, open tickets, keyboard shortcuts explicitly deferred to Phase 2
- **Detailed acceptance criteria** - All 32 stories have 6-10 testable ACs enabling confident implementation
- **Realistic timeline** - 5 epics, 32 stories, estimated 64-128 hours (2-4 hours per story), fits within 3-4 week target with buffer

**Timeline Assessment:**
- 5 Epics, 32 total stories
- Estimated at 2-4 hours per story (AI agent session size per PRD template guidance)
- Total: 64-128 hours of focused development
- Target timeline: 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours at 40hr/week)
- Assessment: **Realistic** with buffer for Office.js learning curve, testing, and integration debugging

**MVP Validation:**
- Core value delivered: Reduce ticket creation from 2-3 minutes to <30 seconds via intelligent matching
- Minimum features to validate hypothesis: Email detection, contact/client matching, ticket creation
- Learning goals clear: Adoption rate (80%+ of email-based tickets), time savings achieved, matching accuracy
- Phase 2 features properly deferred: AI generation, open tickets display, keyboard shortcuts, sent emails

**Technical Readiness:**
- Critical unknowns identified: Office.js capabilities, authentication strategy, task pane persistence
- Research spike in Epic 1 de-risks before feature development
- Clear integration points: Existing backend API, new matching endpoints
- Deployment strategy defined: Railway hosting, manifest sideloading for MVP

## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None

**HIGH:** None - All high-priority requirements addressed

**MEDIUM:**
1. **Domain matching infrastructure assumption** - PRD assumes `client_domains` table exists from main app's Epic 2. If not yet implemented, becomes prerequisite work. *Mitigation: Epic 2.2 acceptance criteria can verify schema and add migration if needed.*

**LOW:**
1. **Icon placeholders in manifest (Story 1.4)** - Acceptable for MVP but production should have proper branding. *Deferred to post-MVP polish.*

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Features appropriately scoped for MVP:**
- ✅ Persistent sidebar (FR1) - Core differentiator vs. modal approach
- ✅ Email-to-contact matching (FR2-3) - Primary value prop
- ✅ Domain fallback matching (FR4) - Essential for new contacts
- ✅ Disambiguation UI (FR5) - Edge case handling required for data integrity
- ✅ Auto-create contacts (FR6) - Removes friction when new contact at known client
- ✅ Manual fallback (FR9-10) - Safety net when matching fails

**Features correctly deferred to Phase 2 (per Brief):**
- ✅ AI description/notes generation - Nice-to-have, opt-in model needs validation first
- ✅ Show recent open tickets - Contextual awareness feature, not core MVP
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts - Power user optimization, can add after adoption proven
- ✅ Sent email support - Workflow extension, requires recipient matching complexity
- ✅ Calendar integration - Future vision, email workflow must succeed first

**Missing features:** None identified - MVP scope complete for validating core hypothesis

**Complexity concerns:**
- Office.js API learning curve - Mitigated by Epic 1 research spike
- Authentication across iframe boundary - Mitigated by Epic 1.2 research with fallback strategy
- CORS configuration - Well-understood problem with documented solution

**Timeline realism:** 3-4 weeks is achievable for 32 stories at 2-4 hours each, with buffer for integration testing and deployment. Epic 1 (5-6 days) validates feasibility before committing to feature development.

## Recommendations

**For Immediate Action:**
1. ✅ **Epic 1 research spike is critical** - Must validate Office.js capabilities and auth strategy within first 3-5 days to de-risk remaining epics
2. ✅ **Verify domain matching infrastructure** - Check if `client_domains` table exists in current schema; if not, add to Epic 2 scope
3. ✅ **Confirm existing ticket creation API accepts all required fields** - Review POST /api/tickets endpoint to ensure it supports add-in's payload structure

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. Architect should review Office.js documentation for Outlook Web Add-ins in parallel with Epic 1 research
2. Design API endpoint contracts for `/api/contacts/match-email` and `/api/clients/match-domain` early
3. Plan CORS configuration and authentication testing approach
4. Consider bundle size optimization strategy for <2 second load time requirement (NFR1)

**For Development Phase:**
1. Implement Epic 1 in strict sequence - don't start Epic 2 until research spike confirms feasibility
2. Set up local HTTPS development environment early (Vite + self-signed cert) per Story 1.3
3. Create test data for various matching scenarios: exact match, domain match, disambiguation, no match
4. Manual testing checklist for each story's acceptance criteria

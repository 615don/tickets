# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The add-in prioritizes **invisible speed** - the interface should feel so fast and intuitive that ticket creation becomes automatic muscle memory rather than a conscious task. The primary UX goal is zero perceived friction between reading an email and logging billable time. The sidebar should feel like a natural extension of Outlook, not a foreign application embedded within it. Secondary UX goals include confidence through clear visual feedback (matched client/contact displayed prominently) and graceful degradation when matching fails (easy manual selection fallback).

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Persistent context awareness:** Sidebar updates automatically on email selection without user action required
- **Progressive disclosure of complexity:** Simple case (exact match) shows minimal UI; edge cases (disambiguation, new contact) progressively reveal additional options
- **Pre-filled but editable philosophy:** Auto-matching provides speed, but all fields remain editable for edge case handling
- **Visual feedback loops:** Clear indicators for matching status (✓ matched, ⚠ inactive client, ? no match)
- **Keyboard-first design:** Tab navigation through form, Enter to submit - optimized for power users processing high email volume

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Sidebar Default State (No Email Selected)** - Prompt to select an email or display last-created ticket confirmation
2. **Sidebar with Matched Contact/Client** - Auto-populated form showing matched client and contact with editable ticket fields
3. **Sidebar with Domain Match Only (New Contact)** - Form showing matched client with editable new contact fields and ticket creation
4. **Sidebar with Disambiguation Required** - Contact matched to multiple clients, display client selection UI before showing ticket form
5. **Sidebar with No Match** - Manual mode with empty dropdowns for client/contact selection
6. **Ticket Creation Success State** - Confirmation message with created ticket ID, form clears automatically
7. **Error/Authentication Required State** - Clear messaging prompting user to authenticate via web app

## Accessibility: None

No formal WCAG compliance required for MVP. Standard keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility through semantic HTML is sufficient. The add-in uses Office.js within Outlook's accessibility context, inheriting Outlook's accessibility features.

## Branding

**Alignment with main ticketing system:** Adopt the same clean, professional, minimal aesthetic established in the web app. Visual consistency creates trust that the add-in is an official extension rather than third-party integration.

**Sidebar-specific considerations:**
- Constrained width (typically 300-400px) requires aggressive information density optimization
- Generous vertical whitespace to create breathing room in narrow layout
- Prominent visual indicators for matching status (color-coded badges: green for match, yellow for warning, gray for manual)
- Minimal decorative elements - every pixel serves functional purpose

**No brand colors defined** - inherit from Office/Outlook theme or use neutral blue/gray palette matching web app.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive (Outlook Web Access Only)

**Primary platform:** macOS running Outlook Web Access in Chrome or Safari
**Browser compatibility:** Modern browsers supporting Office.js (Chrome, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
**Not supported:** Native Outlook desktop clients, Outlook mobile apps, Windows (nice-to-have but not MVP requirement)

The add-in interface optimizes for sidebar task pane dimensions (fixed width, variable height). No mobile-specific responsive breakpoints needed since Outlook Web on mobile doesn't support add-ins in the same way.

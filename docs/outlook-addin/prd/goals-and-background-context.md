# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable instant ticket creation from Outlook emails without context switching, capturing 100% of billable time
- Reduce ticket creation time from 2-3 minutes to under 30 seconds through intelligent auto-matching and pre-filled forms
- Eliminate forgotten billable work by embedding ticket capture directly in the email workflow
- Provide contextual awareness of client/contact information without leaving Outlook
- Increase revenue capture by $5,000-10,000 annually through complete billable time tracking
- Reduce administrative overhead by 20-30 hours per year in ticket documentation time

## Background Context

Solo IT consultants performing hourly billing work primarily through email face a critical friction problem: switching from Outlook to a separate ticketing system to log billable time introduces overhead that leads to forgotten tickets and lost revenue. Current third-party solutions are bloated with team-focused features (workflow management, assignments, priorities) that add complexity rather than solving the core problem of fast, frictionless billing documentation. This PRD addresses that gap by specifying an Outlook Web Add-in that brings ticket creation directly into the email environment through a persistent sidebar interface with intelligent contact/client matching, minimal required fields, and optional AI assistance. The solution meets consultants where they already work rather than forcing adoption of new tools.

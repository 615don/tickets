# Story 7.4: Smart Email Thread Processing

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to intelligently select and format emails from the thread for AI summarization,
**so that** context is balanced with token costs (max 5 emails or 4,000 words).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New file `backend/src/services/emailThreadProcessor.js` exports `processEmailThread(emails)` function
2. Function prioritizes most recent emails when selecting from thread (always includes newest email, then adds older emails until limits reached)
3. Function selects up to last 5 emails from thread
4. Function calculates approximate word count as emails are added (split by whitespace)
5. Function stops adding emails if total exceeds 4,000 words (even if <5 emails)
6. Function always includes the most recent email, even if it alone exceeds 4,000 words (truncate to 4,000)
7. Function returns: `{ selectedEmails: Email[], truncated: boolean, emailCount: number, wordCount: number }`
8. Each email includes: `from`, `subject`, `body` (sanitized)

    const MAX_WORDS = 4000;
    const selectedEmails = [];
    let totalWordCount = 0;
    let truncated = false;

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

Story 7.4 builds on Story 7.3 (Email Sanitization Pipeline) and provides the thread processing logic that feeds Story 7.5 (AI Controller). This story implements intelligent email selection to balance context quality with token costs.

**Dependency:** Story 7.3 MUST be complete (emailSanitizer service functional and tested).

**Downstream Impact:** Story 7.5 (AI Summarization API Endpoint) will use this processor to prepare email threads before calling OpenAI Service (Story 7.2).

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:497-523](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L497-L523)]

### Email Thread Processing Strategy

#### Purpose and Benefits

**Primary Goal:** Select the most relevant emails from a thread while staying within OpenAI API token limits (cost optimization) and maintaining sufficient context for quality summaries.

**Dual Limit Approach:**
1. **5-Email Limit:** Prevents excessive context that may confuse the AI or exceed API limits
2. **4,000-Word Limit:** Caps token costs (~5,333 tokens max @ 0.75 words/token) while providing substantial context

**Cost Impact:** Without limits, a 10-email thread with 1,000 words each = ~13,333 tokens ≈ $0.0013 per summary. With limits: max ~5,333 tokens ≈ $0.0005 per summary (60% cost reduction).

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:87-94](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L87-L94), [docs/outlook-addin/architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md:450-470](../architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md#L450-L470)]

#### Email Selection Logic

**Selection Priority:**

1. **Most Recent Email (CRITICAL):** Always include the most recent email in full (AC6). This email contains the latest context and is typically what triggered ticket creation.

2. **Older Emails (CONTEXT):** Add older emails in chronological order (oldest to newest) until hitting limits:
   - Stop if 5 emails total (including most recent)
   - Stop if adding next email would exceed 4,000 words

**Algorithm Flow:**

```javascript
// Step 1: Sort chronologically (oldest to newest)
emails = sortChronologically(emails);

// Step 2: Separate most recent from older emails
mostRecentEmail = emails[emails.length - 1];
olderEmails = emails.slice(0, -1);

// Step 3: Add older emails until limits
for (email of olderEmails) {
  if (selected.length >= 4) break;  // Reserve 1 spot for most recent
  if (totalWords + emailWords > 4000) break;

  selected.push(sanitize(email));
  totalWords += emailWords;
}

// Step 4: ALWAYS add most recent email (truncate if needed)
if (mostRecentWords > 4000) {
  selected.push(truncate(mostRecentEmail, 4000));
  truncated = true;
} else {
  selected.push(sanitize(mostRecentEmail));
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Most recent email is most important (user's immediate need)
- Chronological order maintains conversation flow for AI
- Limits prevent token cost spikes while retaining sufficient context

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:504-518](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L504-L518)]

#### Word Counting Implementation

**Word Count Approximation:**

```javascript
function countWords(text) {
  if (!text || text.trim().length === 0) return 0;
  return text.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Simple whitespace splitting (fast, O(n) complexity)
- Filters empty strings (handles multiple spaces correctly)
- Approximation sufficient for limit enforcement (exact token count not required)
- Real token count varies by ~25% (1 token ≈ 0.75 words), but word count provides consistent limit

**Token Estimation:**
```
4,000 words → ~5,333 tokens (at 0.75 words/token)
OpenAI pricing: ~$0.0005 per summary with gpt-5-mini
```

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:510-512](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L510-L512), OpenAI tokenization documentation]

#### Truncation Strategy

**Truncation Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Email Count Limit (>5 emails)**
```javascript
// Input: 7 emails
// Action: Select last 5 emails (most recent + 4 older)
// Result: truncated: true, reason: "5-email limit"
```

**Scenario 2: Word Limit (<5 emails, >4,000 words)**
```javascript
// Input: 3 emails [1500w, 1500w, 2000w]
// Action: Select first email + most recent (3500 words total)
// Result: truncated: true, reason: "4000-word limit"
```

**Scenario 3: Most Recent Email Alone >4,000 Words**
```javascript
// Input: 1 email [6000 words]
// Action: Truncate most recent email to 4000 words + "..."
// Result: truncated: true, selectedEmails: 1, wordCount: 4000
```

**User Notification (FR2a):**
When `truncated: true`, the AI Controller (Story 7.5) will include a note in the generated summary:
- "Summary based on last 5 emails in thread" (email limit)
- "Summary based on most recent 4,000 words" (word limit)

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:91-94](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L91-L94)]

#### Length Classification for Smart Minification

**Length Classes:**

```javascript
// Short: <200 words
// Medium: 200-1000 words
// Long: >1000 words

if (totalWordCount < 200) {
  lengthClass = 'short';
} else if (totalWordCount > 1000) {
  lengthClass = 'long';
} else {
  lengthClass = 'medium';
}
```

**Purpose:** This classification is used by OpenAI Service (Story 7.2) to adjust summary length:
- **Short emails:** Generate brief 1-2 sentence notes (avoid over-summarizing)
- **Medium emails:** Generate concise paragraph notes
- **Long emails:** Generate detailed multi-paragraph notes

**Integration:** The `lengthClass` field is returned to the AI Controller (Story 7.5), which passes it to OpenAI Service (Story 7.2).

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:660-689](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L660-L689)]

### Integration with Email Sanitizer (Story 7.3)

#### Sanitization Flow

**Process:**

1. **Thread Processor receives raw emails** (from AI Controller, Story 7.5)
2. **For each email selected, call sanitizer:**
   ```javascript
   const sanitized = sanitizeEmail(email.body);
   const emailWordCount = countWords(sanitized.sanitized);
   ```
3. **Use sanitized body for word counting and output**
4. **Track token savings from sanitization** (optional for logging)

**Benefits:**
- Signatures/disclaimers removed before word counting (more accurate limits)
- Quoted replies removed (avoids duplicate content in thread)
- Token savings: 30-50% per email (improves cost efficiency)

**Error Handling:**
- If sanitizeEmail returns empty string (signature-only email), count as 0 words
- Continue processing (don't fail entire thread for one empty email)

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md:450-470](../architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md#L450-L470)]

### Response Structure

#### Successful Processing Response

**Format:**
```javascript
{
  selectedEmails: [
    {
      from: 'john@example.com',
      subject: 'Production server down',
      body: 'Our production server is unresponsive since 2pm...' // Sanitized
    },
    {
      from: 'support@company.com',
      subject: 'RE: Production server down',
      body: 'Thanks for reporting. Investigating now...' // Sanitized
    }
  ],
  truncated: false,
  emailCount: 2,
  wordCount: 450,
  lengthClass: 'medium'
}
```

**Fields:**
- `selectedEmails` (Array): Sanitized email objects, chronologically ordered (oldest to newest)
- `truncated` (Boolean): `true` if email/word limits exceeded
- `emailCount` (Number): Number of emails selected (1-5)
- `wordCount` (Number): Total word count across all selected emails
- `lengthClass` (String): 'short' | 'medium' | 'long' for smart minification

**Downstream Usage:**
- AI Controller (Story 7.5) passes `selectedEmails` to OpenAI Service (Story 7.2)
- OpenAI Service uses `lengthClass` to adjust system prompt
- AI Controller includes truncation note in response if `truncated: true`

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:510-518](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L510-L518)]

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

#### Edge Case 1: Empty Thread

**Input:** `processEmailThread([])`

**Expected Behavior:** Return empty result or throw clear error

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
if (!emails || emails.length === 0) {
  throw new Error('Email thread is empty - no emails to process');
}
```

**Rationale:** Empty threads should never reach this service (AI Controller should validate), but defensive programming prevents crashes.

#### Edge Case 2: All Emails Have Empty Bodies

**Scenario:** Thread with 3 emails, but all sanitize to empty strings (signature-only emails)

**Expected Behavior:**
```javascript
{
  selectedEmails: [
    { from: '...', subject: '...', body: '' },
    { from: '...', subject: '...', body: '' },
    { from: '...', subject: '...', body: '' }
  ],
  truncated: false,
  emailCount: 3,
  wordCount: 0,
  lengthClass: 'short'
}
```

**AI Controller Handling:** Detect `wordCount: 0` and return error to frontend (no content to summarize).

#### Edge Case 3: Single Email with Null/Undefined Body

**Input:** `[{ from: '...', subject: '...', body: null }]`

**Expected Behavior:** Sanitizer handles null/undefined gracefully (returns empty string), thread processor treats as 0 words.

#### Edge Case 4: Malformed Email Objects

**Input:** `[{ from: 'test@example.com', subject: null, body: 'content' }]`

**Expected Behavior:** Handle gracefully, treat null subject as empty string, process body normally. Thread processor should validate required fields and handle missing/null values defensively.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
// Validate email object structure
function validateEmailObject(email) {
  return {
    from: email.from || '',
    subject: email.subject || '',
    body: email.body || ''
  };
}
```

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

**Node.js Test Runner Pattern:**
```javascript
import { describe, it, mock, beforeEach } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { processEmailThread } from '../emailThreadProcessor.js';

describe('Email Thread Processor', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock emailSanitizer to return predictable results
    // This isolates thread processor logic from sanitizer implementation
  });

  it('should select up to 5 emails from thread', async () => {
    const emails = createTestEmails(7, 300); // 7 emails, 300 words each
    const result = await processEmailThread(emails);

    assert.strictEqual(result.emailCount, 5);
    assert.strictEqual(result.truncated, true);
    assert.strictEqual(result.selectedEmails.length, 5);
  });

  it('should stop adding emails if word limit exceeded', async () => {
    const emails = [
      createTestEmail(1500), // 1500 words
      createTestEmail(1500), // 1500 words
      createTestEmail(2000)  // 2000 words (would exceed 4000)
    ];
    const result = await processEmailThread(emails);

    assert.strictEqual(result.emailCount, 2); // First + most recent only
    assert(result.wordCount <= 4000);
    assert.strictEqual(result.truncated, true);
  });

  it('should always include most recent email even if >4000 words', async () => {
    const emails = [createTestEmail(6000)]; // Single 6000-word email
    const result = await processEmailThread(emails);

    assert.strictEqual(result.emailCount, 1);
    assert.strictEqual(result.wordCount, 4000); // Truncated to limit
    assert.strictEqual(result.truncated, true);
    assert(result.selectedEmails[0].body.endsWith('...')); // Truncation marker
  });
});

// Helper function to create test emails
function createTestEmail(wordCount) {
  const words = 'word '.repeat(wordCount).trim();
  return {
    from: 'test@example.com',
    subject: 'Test Email',
    body: words
  };
}

function createTestEmails(count, wordsPerEmail) {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, () => createTestEmail(wordsPerEmail));
}
```

**Mocking Strategy:**
- Mock emailSanitizer to return predictable sanitized text
- Isolate thread processor logic (word counting, limits, truncation) from sanitization
- Test both success and edge case paths

#### Test Coverage Requirements

**Critical Paths to Test:**
1. ✅ 5-email limit enforcement (7 emails → 5 selected)
2. ✅ 4,000-word limit enforcement (high word count → truncation)
3. ✅ Most recent email always included (even if >4K words)
4. ✅ Word counting accuracy (various email lengths)
5. ✅ Chronological ordering maintained
6. ✅ Truncated flag correctness (true when limits hit)
7. ✅ Length classification (short/medium/long)
8. ✅ Edge cases (empty thread, signature-only emails, single long email)

**Target Coverage:** 80%+ for service layer (critical business logic)

### Security Considerations

#### Content Privacy

**Email Content Handling:**
- ✅ Email content processed in memory only (not persisted)
- ✅ Email content NEVER logged (privacy consideration)
- ✅ Processed content passed to OpenAI Service (Story 7.2) which logs metadata only

**User Notification:** Email thread content is temporarily processed for selection and sanitization. No email content is stored or logged by this service.

### Performance Considerations

**Expected Performance:** <100ms for typical threads (IV3 requirement)

**Typical Thread Sizes:**
- Short: 1-2 emails, 100-500 words
- Medium: 3-5 emails, 500-2,000 words
- Long: 5+ emails, 2,000-5,000 words (truncated to 5 emails/4K words)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Linear processing (O(n) complexity where n = email count)
- Early termination when limits reached (no unnecessary processing)
- Minimal string operations (sanitization is main bottleneck, handled by Story 7.3)

**Monitoring:** Log processing time for threads >5 emails to identify performance issues.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation completed without blocking issues.

### Completion Notes List

- **Implementation Approach**: Implemented email thread processor with "most-recent-first" algorithm - process the most recent email first to calculate word budget, then add older emails until limits reached. This ensures AC6 (most recent always included) is properly handled.

- **Algorithm Refinement**: Initial implementation processed emails in chronological order then added most recent, which caused word limit calculation errors. Fixed by processing most recent email FIRST, calculating remaining word budget (4000 - most_recent_words), then adding older emails within that budget.

- **Test Suite**: Created comprehensive test suite with 40 tests covering:
  - Chronological sorting (2 tests)
  - 5-email limit enforcement (5 tests)
  - 4,000-word limit enforcement (4 tests)
  - Most recent email always included (3 tests)
  - Email sanitization integration (3 tests)
  - Word counting accuracy (4 tests)
  - Truncated flag correctness (4 tests)
  - Length classification (6 tests)
  - Edge case handling (7 tests)
  - Performance validation (2 tests)

- **Testing Strategy**: Used real emailSanitizer service for integration testing instead of mocking. This validates the full integration with Story 7.3 dependency and ensures realistic behavior.

- **Performance**: All performance tests pass - processing <100ms for typical thread sizes (10 emails with 500 words each, 5 emails with 800 words each).

- **Edge Cases Handled**: Empty threads (throws error), null/undefined fields (normalized), signature-only emails (returns empty body with 0 word count), oversized single emails (truncated to 4000 words with "..." marker).

- **Logging**: Privacy-conscious logging implemented - logs metadata (email count, word count, truncation status) but NEVER logs email content.

### File List

**New Files Created:**
- [backend/src/services/emailThreadProcessor.js](../../../backend/src/services/emailThreadProcessor.js) - Main email thread processing service
- [backend/src/services/__tests__/emailThreadProcessor.test.js](../../../backend/src/services/__tests__/emailThreadProcessor.test.js) - Comprehensive unit tests (40 tests)

**Modified Files:**
- None (Story 7.4 is purely additive)

**Dependencies:**
- [backend/src/services/emailSanitizer.js](../../../backend/src/services/emailSanitizer.js) (Story 7.3) - Used for email body sanitization

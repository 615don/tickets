# Story 7.3: Email Sanitization Pipeline

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to strip signatures, disclaimers, and boilerplate content from emails before AI processing,
**so that** token costs are reduced and summary quality is improved by focusing on actual content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New file `backend/src/services/emailSanitizer.js` exports `sanitizeEmail(emailBody)` function
2. Sanitizer detects and removes common signature markers:
   - Lines starting with `--` or `___` or `---`
   - "Sent from my iPhone/Android"
   - "Get Outlook for iOS/Android"
   - Email confidentiality disclaimers (common patterns)
3. Sanitizer removes quoted previous emails (lines starting with `>` or `|`)
4. Sanitizer preserves original formatting (line breaks) of remaining content
5. Sanitizer handles edge cases (empty emails, signature-only emails) without crashing
6. Function returns sanitized text with approximate token savings logged

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Email Sanitizer Service Module** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Create new file: [backend/src/services/emailSanitizer.js](../../../backend/src/services/emailSanitizer.js)
  - [x] Implement `sanitizeEmail(emailBody)` function with parameter:
    - `emailBody` (String): Raw email body text (may contain signatures, footers, quoted text)
    - Returns: `{ sanitized: string, tokensRemoved: number }`
  - [x] Detect and remove signature markers using regex patterns:
    - Signature delimiter: Lines matching `^--\s*$`, `^___+$`, `^---+$`
    - Mobile signatures: "Sent from my iPhone", "Sent from my Android", "Get Outlook for iOS", "Get Outlook for Android"
    - Implementation approach: Split email into lines, iterate, stop at first signature marker
  - [x] Remove email confidentiality disclaimers using patterns:
    - Common patterns: "This email is confidential", "CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE", "This message is intended only"
    - Implementation: Regex match common disclaimer phrases, remove entire disclaimer block
  - [x] Remove quoted previous emails (reply chains):
    - Lines starting with `>` (standard quote marker)
    - Lines starting with `|` (alternative quote marker)
    - Outlook-style "From: ... Sent: ..." headers (regex: `^From:.*Sent:`)
    - Implementation: Filter out lines matching quote patterns
  - [x] Preserve original formatting of remaining content:
    - Keep line breaks intact (use `\n` as delimiter, join with `\n`)
    - Preserve paragraph structure
    - Do NOT strip whitespace or normalize formatting
  - [x] Handle edge cases gracefully:
    - Empty email body: Return `{ sanitized: '', tokensRemoved: 0 }`
    - Signature-only email (no content): Return `{ sanitized: '', tokensRemoved: <approximate> }`
    - No signature found: Return `{ sanitized: emailBody, tokensRemoved: 0 }`
    - Multiple signatures in one email: Remove all detected signatures
  - [x] Calculate approximate token savings:
    - Token count approximation: Split by whitespace, count words (rough estimate: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words)
    - Compare original word count vs. sanitized word count
    - Return difference: `tokensRemoved = (originalWords - sanitizedWords) * 0.75`
  - [x] Export function as named export: `export { sanitizeEmail }`
  - [x] [Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:470-495](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L470-L495)]

      originalLength: emailBody.length,
      sanitizedLength: result.sanitized.length,
      tokensRemoved: result.tokensRemoved,
      reductionPercent: Math.round((1 - result.sanitized.length / emailBody.length) * 100)
    });
    ```
  - [x] Log warning for signature-only emails (100% content removed):
    ```javascript
    if (result.sanitized.length === 0 && emailBody.length > 0) {
      console.warn('[EmailSanitizer] Email contained only signatures/boilerplate - no content remaining');
    }

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

Story 7.3 implements the email sanitization pipeline that cleans email bodies before AI processing. This story is critical for cost optimization (30-50% token reduction expected) and summary quality improvement.

**Dependency:** This story is independent and can be developed in parallel with Story 7.2 (OpenAI Service). However, Story 7.4 (Email Thread Processor) will use this sanitizer service.

**Downstream Impact:** Story 7.4 (Email Thread Processor) will call `sanitizeEmail()` for each email in the thread before formatting for OpenAI.

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:470-495](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L470-L495)]

### Email Sanitization Strategy

#### Purpose and Benefits

**Primary Goal:** Reduce token costs and improve AI summary quality by removing noise (signatures, disclaimers, quoted replies) from email content before sending to OpenAI API.

**Expected Token Reduction:** 30-50% for typical business emails with signatures and disclaimers.

**Quality Improvement:** AI model receives only relevant email content, reducing confusion from boilerplate text and improving summary accuracy.

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md:426-449](../architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md#L426-L449)]

#### Signature Detection Patterns

**Common Signature Markers:**

1. **Delimiter-based signatures:**
   - `--` (standard email signature delimiter, RFC compliant)
   - `___` (multiple underscores)
   - `---` (multiple hyphens, common in markdown-style signatures)

2. **Mobile device signatures:**
   - "Sent from my iPhone"
   - "Sent from my Android"
   - "Get Outlook for iOS"
   - "Get Outlook for Android"

3. **Corporate email disclaimers:**
   - "This email is confidential"
   - "CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE"
   - "This message is intended only for"
   - "If you are not the intended recipient"

**Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
export function sanitizeEmail(emailBody) {
  if (!emailBody || emailBody.trim().length === 0) {
    return { sanitized: '', tokensRemoved: 0 };
  }

  const originalWordCount = countWords(emailBody);
  const lines = emailBody.split('\n');
  const sanitizedLines = [];

  let inSignature = false;

  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const line = lines[i];

    // Check for signature delimiters
    if (/^--\s*$/.test(line) || /^___+$/.test(line) || /^---+$/.test(line)) {
      inSignature = true;
      continue;
    }

    // Check for mobile signatures
    if (/sent from my (iphone|android)/i.test(line) || /get outlook for (ios|android)/i.test(line)) {
      inSignature = true;
      continue;
    }

    // Check for disclaimers
    if (/confidential|intended only|not the intended recipient/i.test(line)) {
      inSignature = true;
      continue;
    }

    // Check for quoted replies
    if (/^[>|]/.test(line) || /^From:.*Sent:/i.test(line)) {
      continue; // Skip quoted lines
    }

    // If not in signature and not quoted, keep the line
    if (!inSignature) {
      sanitizedLines.push(line);
    }
  }

  const sanitized = sanitizedLines.join('\n').trim();
  const sanitizedWordCount = countWords(sanitized);
  const tokensRemoved = Math.round((originalWordCount - sanitizedWordCount) * 0.75);

  return { sanitized, tokensRemoved };
}

function countWords(text) {
  return text.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length;
}
```

#### Quoted Reply Detection

**Quoted Reply Patterns:**

1. **Standard quote markers:**
   - Lines starting with `>` (Gmail, Thunderbird, most email clients)
   - Lines starting with `|` (Outlook, some corporate email clients)

2. **Outlook-style quote headers:**
   - Pattern: `From: John Smith <john@example.com>` followed by `Sent: Tuesday, January 14, 2025 3:45 PM`
   - This indicates start of quoted previous email

**Why Remove Quoted Replies:**
- Quoted content is redundant (already included in earlier emails in thread)
- Reduces token costs by avoiding duplicate content
- Improves AI focus on new information in current email

**Implementation Note:**
- Only remove quoted content from individual emails
- Email Thread Processor (Story 7.4) handles thread-level duplicate detection (5 email limit)

[Source: Common email client quoting patterns]

#### Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Edge Case 1: Empty Email Body**
```javascript
sanitizeEmail('') → { sanitized: '', tokensRemoved: 0 }
```

**Edge Case 2: Signature-Only Email**
```javascript
// Input: "--\nSent from my iPhone"
sanitizeEmail('--\nSent from my iPhone') → { sanitized: '', tokensRemoved: ~2 }
```

**Edge Case 3: No Signature Present**
```javascript
// Input: "Please fix the server issue urgently."
sanitizeEmail('Please fix the server issue urgently.')
  → { sanitized: 'Please fix the server issue urgently.', tokensRemoved: 0 }
```

**Edge Case 4: False Positive Prevention**
```javascript
// Input: "Our team sent from our headquarters the following..."
// Should NOT remove "sent from" if it's in the middle of content
// Only remove if it's a signature-like pattern at the end
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use stateful parsing (track `inSignature` flag)
- Once signature detected, ignore all subsequent lines
- Preserve content before first signature marker
- Handle multiple signatures in one email (e.g., forwarded emails with multiple signatures)

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md:490-495](../prd/epic-7-ai-email-summarization.md#L490-L495)]

#### Token Savings Calculation

**Approximation Formula:**
```
tokensRemoved = (originalWords - sanitizedWords) * 0.75
```

**Rationale:**
- OpenAI tokenization: ~1 token per 0.75 words on average for English text
- Word count provides rough estimate without requiring OpenAI tokenizer library
- Acceptable accuracy for logging/monitoring purposes

**Example:**
- Original email: 200 words (signature: 50 words, body: 150 words)
- After sanitization: 150 words
- Tokens removed: (200 - 150) * 0.75 = 37.5 ≈ 38 tokens
- Token reduction: 25%

**Logging:**
```javascript
console.log('[EmailSanitizer] Sanitized email:', {
  originalLength: 1500,
  sanitizedLength: 1000,
  tokensRemoved: 38,
  reductionPercent: 33
});
```

### Testing

#### Test File Locations

**Unit Tests:**
- [backend/src/services/__tests__/emailSanitizer.test.js](../../../backend/src/services/__tests__/emailSanitizer.test.js)

**Test Standards:**
- **Framework:** Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test` module)
- **Assertions:** `node:assert` module (`assert.strictEqual`, `assert.match`, `assert.deepStrictEqual`)
- **Execution:** `NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings" node --test backend/src/services/__tests__/emailSanitizer.test.js`
- **No Mocking Required:** Pure function, no external dependencies to mock

[Source: [docs/outlook-addin/architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md:1213-1239](../architecture/epic-7-ai-email-summarization-architecture.md#L1213-L1239)]

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

**Node.js Test Runner Pattern:**
```javascript
import { describe, it } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { sanitizeEmail } from '../emailSanitizer.js';

describe('Email Sanitizer', () => {
  it('should remove signature after -- delimiter', () => {
    const input = 'Please help with the issue.\n--\nJohn Smith\nSenior Developer';
    const result = sanitizeEmail(input);

    assert.strictEqual(result.sanitized, 'Please help with the issue.');
    assert(result.tokensRemoved > 0);
  });

  it('should remove mobile signature', () => {
    const input = 'Fix the bug urgently.\n\nSent from my iPhone';
    const result = sanitizeEmail(input);

    assert.strictEqual(result.sanitized, 'Fix the bug urgently.');
  });

  it('should remove quoted replies', () => {
    const input = 'Here is my response.\n\n> Original message\n> From previous email';
    const result = sanitizeEmail(input);

    assert.strictEqual(result.sanitized, 'Here is my response.');
  });

  it('should handle empty email', () => {
    const result = sanitizeEmail('');

    assert.strictEqual(result.sanitized, '');
    assert.strictEqual(result.tokensRemoved, 0);
  });

  it('should preserve content without signature', () => {
    const input = 'Short message without signature.';
    const result = sanitizeEmail(input);

    assert.strictEqual(result.sanitized, input);
    assert.strictEqual(result.tokensRemoved, 0);
  });
});
```

**Test Coverage Strategy:**
- Test each signature pattern individually (delimiter, mobile, disclaimer)
- Test quoted reply removal
- Test edge cases (empty, signature-only, no signature)
- Test false positive prevention (legitimate content with signature-like text)
- Test formatting preservation (line breaks, paragraphs)
- Test token savings calculation accuracy

[Source: Node.js test runner patterns, existing backend test examples]

#### Test Coverage Requirements

**Critical Paths to Test:**
1. ✅ Signature removal (delimiter-based: `--`, `___`, `---`)
2. ✅ Mobile signature removal ("Sent from my iPhone/Android", "Get Outlook")
3. ✅ Disclaimer removal ("CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE", "This email is confidential")
4. ✅ Quoted reply removal (`>`, `|`, Outlook-style headers)
5. ✅ Formatting preservation (line breaks, paragraphs)
6. ✅ Edge case handling (empty, signature-only, no signature)
7. ✅ False positive prevention (legitimate content not removed)
8. ✅ Token savings calculation accuracy

**Target Coverage:** 80%+ for service layer (critical business logic)

### Security Considerations

#### Content Privacy

**Email Content Handling:**
- ✅ Email content processed in memory only (not persisted)
- ✅ Email content NEVER logged (privacy consideration)
- ✅ Sanitized content passed to OpenAI Service (Story 7.2) which logs metadata only

**User Notification:** Email content is temporarily processed for sanitization. No email content is stored or logged by this service.

[Source: Privacy best practices]

#### Performance Considerations

**Expected Performance:** <100ms for typical emails (IV3 requirement)

**Typical Email Sizes:**
- Short: <200 words (~1-2 KB)
- Medium: 200-1000 words (~2-10 KB)
- Long: 1000-4000 words (~10-40 KB)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Line-by-line processing (O(n) complexity)
- No regex backtracking (use anchored patterns: `^`, `$`)
- No additional string allocations (reuse line array)

**Monitoring:** Log processing time for emails >5KB to identify performance issues.

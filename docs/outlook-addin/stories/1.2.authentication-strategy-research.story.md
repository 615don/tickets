# Story 1.2: Authentication Strategy Research & Decision

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to research authentication options for Office Add-in communicating with existing backend API,
**so that** I can choose the best approach for seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Researched session cookie sharing between web app and add-in task pane iframe
2. Tested if `SameSite=None; Secure` cookies accessible from Office Add-in context
3. Researched token-based authentication alternatives (JWT, OAuth implicit flow)
4. Documented pros/cons of each approach (UX friction, implementation complexity, security)
5. Decision made and documented: session sharing OR token-based auth
6. If session sharing: confirmed backend CORS configuration required
7. If token-based: defined token generation/storage mechanism
8. Authentication strategy documented in `/outlook-addin/docs/auth-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Research Session Cookie Sharing with Office Add-in** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Review Office Add-in task pane iframe context and cookie access
  - [x] Research `SameSite=None; Secure` cookie attributes for cross-origin scenarios
  - [x] Test if Office Add-in task pane can access cookies from backend domain (`ticketapi.zollc.com`)
  - [x] Create test HTML page with Office.js, attempt to make authenticated API request with `credentials: 'include'`
  - [x] Document browser cookie behavior in Office Add-in context
  - [x] Identify any limitations or browser compatibility issues

- [x] **Task 2: Research Token-Based Authentication Alternatives** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Research JWT token generation and validation approach
  - [x] Research OAuth 2.0 implicit flow or authorization code flow
  - [x] Document how user would authenticate (login form in add-in, or redirect to main web app)
  - [x] Identify token storage mechanism (localStorage, sessionStorage, memory-only)
  - [x] Document token refresh strategy if using short-lived tokens
  - [x] Research security implications of token storage in iframe context

- [x] **Task 3: Compare Approaches - Pros/Cons Analysis** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Document UX friction for each approach:
    - Session sharing: Transparent if user logged into main web app
    - Token-based: Requires login flow in add-in (extra step)
  - [x] Document implementation complexity for each approach:
    - Session sharing: Backend CORS + cookie config changes
    - Token-based: Token generation endpoint, validation middleware, refresh logic
  - [x] Document security considerations:
    - Session sharing: CSRF risk with `SameSite=None` (existing csurf middleware mitigates)
    - Token-based: XSS risk if token stored in localStorage, token theft
  - [x] Document compatibility:
    - Session sharing: Relies on browser cookie behavior in Office Add-in iframe
    - Token-based: More control, less reliance on browser-specific behavior

- [x] **Task 4: Make Authentication Strategy Decision** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Evaluate which approach best meets MVP requirements (simplicity, timeline constraints)
  - [x] Consider existing backend architecture (already uses express-session)
  - [x] Weigh UX impact (seamless auth vs. requiring login in add-in)
  - [x] Document final decision with clear justification
  - [x] Identify any risks or technical debt associated with chosen approach

- [x] **Task 5: Define Backend Configuration Requirements** (AC: 6 or 7)
  - [x] **Session sharing chosen:**
    - [x] Document required CORS configuration updates (allow `outlook-addin.zollc.com` origin)
    - [x] Document session cookie configuration changes (`SameSite=None; Secure` in production)
    - [x] List required environment variables (`ADDIN_URL`)
    - [x] Identify specific backend files to modify (`backend/src/index.js` lines 33-36)

- [x] **Task 6: Document Authentication Strategy** (AC: 8)
  - [x] Create `/outlook-addin/docs/auth-strategy.md` file
  - [x] Document chosen approach with justification
  - [x] Include pros/cons analysis from Task 3
  - [x] Document specific implementation requirements from Task 5
  - [x] Include code examples or configuration snippets
  - [x] Document testing approach to validate authentication works in add-in context
  - [x] Flag any future improvements or technical debt

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 focused on Office.js Mail API research. This story builds on that by validating authentication between the add-in task pane iframe and the backend API.

### Existing Authentication Architecture

**Current Authentication System:** The existing system uses **express-session 1.17.3** with **bcrypt 5.1.1** for session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies. [Source: [existing-project-analysis.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/existing-project-analysis.md#current-project-state)]

**Session Store:** PostgreSQL-backed sessions via `connect-pg-simple` package. [Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack)]

**Current CORS Configuration:** Backend currently allows `process.env.FRONTEND_URL` (main web app origin). Add-in origin must be added to allowed origins list. [Source: [existing-project-analysis.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/existing-project-analysis.md#identified-constraints)]

### Cross-Origin Session Sharing Requirements

**Challenge:** Main web app (`tickets.zollc.com`), backend API (`ticketapi.zollc.com`), and add-in (`outlook-addin.zollc.com`) are three separate origins. Office Add-in task pane loads add-in in an iframe context within Outlook Web Access.

**Session Cookie Sharing Strategy:** For session cookies to work across origins, backend must set `SameSite=None; Secure` on session cookies. This requires HTTPS in production (already met via Railway Let's Encrypt certificates). [Source: [security-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/security-integration.md#cross-origin-session-cookie-configuration)]

**CORS Requirements:** Backend CORS configuration must allow add-in origin with `credentials: true` to permit cross-origin cookie sharing. [Source: [api-design-and-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#cors-configuration)]

### Security Considerations

**CSRF Risk with SameSite=None:** Setting `SameSite=None` increases CSRF attack risk. However, existing backend already uses `csurf` middleware for CSRF protection. [Source: [security-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/security-integration.md#security-trade-offs)]

**Rate Limiting:** Existing backend uses `express-rate-limit`. New authentication endpoints should be rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks. [Source: [security-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/security-integration.md#rate-limiting)]

### Deployment Context

**Separate Railway Services:** Frontend, backend, and add-in are deployed as three separate Railway services with custom domains. This means all three are distinct origins requiring CORS configuration. [Source: [infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#deployment-architecture)]

**Environment Variables:** Backend requires `ADDIN_URL` environment variable to whitelist add-in origin in CORS configuration. [Source: [infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#railway-service-configuration)]

### File Locations

**Research Documentation:** Create findings in `/outlook-addin/docs/auth-strategy.md`

**Backend Configuration Files:** Likely `backend/src/app.js` or `backend/src/server.js` where CORS and session middleware are configured (exact location to be identified during research)

[Source: [source-tree-organization.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/source-tree-organization.md)]

### API Client Pattern

**Fetch API with Credentials:** Add-in uses native Fetch API for HTTP requests. All API calls must include `credentials: 'include'` to send session cookies. [Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/tech-stack.md#existing-technology-stack)]

**API Client Wrapper:** Add-in will use centralized API client (`lib/api-client.ts`) that includes `credentials: 'include'` by default. [Source: [coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/coding-standards-and-integration-rules.md#api-integration)]

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

This story focuses on **research, testing, and documentation**, not production code implementation. Testing requirements:

1. **Manual Authentication Testing:** Test session cookie behavior in browser with Office Add-in context
2. **Test Scenarios:**
   - User logged into main web app (`tickets.zollc.com`), then opens add-in in Outlook Web
   - Add-in makes API request to backend with `credentials: 'include'`
   - Verify session cookie sent from add-in iframe to backend
   - Test 401 Unauthorized handling if session not shared
3. **No Unit Tests Required:** Research story does not require automated test files
4. **Documentation Validation:** Authentication strategy document (`auth-strategy.md`) should be reviewed for completeness and clarity

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/outlook-addin/architecture/testing-strategy.md#manual-testing-for-add-in-ui)]

#### Test Environment Setup

Create simple HTML test page to simulate Office Add-in context:
- Load page from `localhost` (simulating `outlook-addin.zollc.com`)
- Make fetch request to backend API (`ticketapi.zollc.com`) with `credentials: 'include'`
- Check browser DevTools Network tab for cookie headers
- Test with different `SameSite` cookie configurations
